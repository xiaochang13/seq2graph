what be more they be consider traitor of china , which be a fact of cultural tyranny in the cloak of nationalism and patriotism .
in fact , the us no long need to use force to deal with china , they have achieve the result of " defeat enemy soldier without fight ".

with the chaos in east and north africa , we also have no choice but to prevent the run dog traitor from collude with western imperialism .
everything have its set number , it 's not time for a change in the weather in china , traitor can only bark madly like dog and nothing else , can only make them disappointed .
it won't be long until people be come from all direction to the chinese court . lead the world . this be the intent of heaven .
follow with interest .
this just be a specialty of modern china there 's nothing we can do
there be too many traitor among our compatriot ,
freedom of speech be relative . we need take national condition into account .

yes . there be many slave of foreigner . it 's time we should renovate !
the rule authority actually should pay attention to these kind of capitulators and traitor of china ! comrade deng xiaoping once say that the communist party will not be overthrow - if it fall , it will be bring down from within the party itself . former us ambassador to china mr. huntsman once say in a speech in the us : we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in china , let the chinese themselves topple china - and the cia then use an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so @-@ call elite , vow that they want to let them raise the wind to make wave domestically , citizen definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsider use us .
i have reason to say this : these last several day i have see the suggestion give by the expert - with a glimpse i see they be disciple of wang jingwei !
western society allow these people to see the dawn of fairness and justice of democracy .
the domestic political development be truly too slow , be criticize by people whose ideology be a bit advance be inevitable . can we blame others for this ?
say that someone be bribe be improper ?
people be all selfish , reality also be often gray .
some propaganda activity of zf have soon become view as joke by the people .
in this environment , what 's wrong if they criticize the previous stupefy propaganda a bit ?
we can n't look over the old account of the previous so @-@ call anti @-@ japanese war .
take a look at north korea , that 's our country many year ago . take a look at their ridiculous propaganda .
the unite state ' dream of occupy the whole world have never stop , it be constantly be plan .
these day , there 's a kind of feel that 's more and more intense : it 's that america , through long @-@ term bribe of the chinese intellectual elite have already succeed in set up a " fifth column ".
these people may consider themselves to be culture celebrity or may be of high authority and important position , and be distribute in various circle in society , take great pain to promote american values* and brainwash the chinese people on behalf of the americans .
why be this kind of feel get more and more intense ?
because these day , i 've be read part of the " specialist professor " blog , it would have be okay if i do n't read it , but after i read it , it make me really surprise .
for example , assistant professor zhang ming of renmin university , the political intention of many of his blogs be extremely obvious .
such as , in one blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in china to elementary school textbook have " wang erxiao ", and he disparage good article that promote patriotism as not even worth a penny .
another example be so @-@ call " sexologist " and " social activist " li yinhe - one , her stuff be not similar to thing like the treatise " haite sexology report "; two , she have no deep think ; and three , she have no significant contribution .
she main relies on do something novel and different and on shock viewpoint to attract people 's eye , but without real ability or learn , she 's purely a jump clown ,
this kind of person put on the big " specialist " hat just to intimidate people ; the key be that she be concern about politics yet do n't understand politics , be willing to be a slave of foreigner yet be arrogant and overbear , be ignorant yet feel fine .
like in the essay " a bit less hostility , a bit more harmony ", she completely denigrate class struggle and the anti @-@ pornography @-@ and @-@ illegal @-@ publication drive as social hostility ;
in the essay " china have already become the country which worship money most on the earth ", she attribute chinese society 's worship of money to atheism ;
the essay " are you study paul or study bill ? ", she blather that " people who study paul will become terrorist ";
in the essay " recommendation for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic product ", she take citizen publish pornographic novel to be freedom of speech , and say the beijing anti @-@ pornography drive be unconstitutional behavior , etc.
especially today 's masterpiece , " why be it worth pay such close attention to the jianghe obscene goods case ? ", where she be once again cry foul over several people suspect of involvement in erotic business activity who be be dealt with by beijing city , as well as detail a list of erotic product , with a deep intent of do publicity for other people ."
but these kind of jerky article actually be put on top by sina blog be really preposterous !
and there be also sichuanese poet liu shahe , who , while america clear to the eye and with swell gall engage in containment of china and the people of the whole nation be feel indignant , actually come out with the fallacy " china and america be friendly ", and try to pour spirit @-@ confuse soup on the chinese people willfully and without fear ;
yi zhongtian , who get famous by remark upon the " three country ", whose talent and learn i have always respect , but i do n't expect that he be actually support the big traitor of china , mao yushi , say some thing like " i believe whoever disrespects mao yushi be not human ", once again make me very much drop my glass !
also , as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago " complete note on 100 chinese celebrity who accept political contribution from the ford foundation ", i feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in china who be " become treasonous " be increasingly ardent and have already become willful and without fear , to a level of publicly harm the country .
but i do not understand , when these people frequently make treasonous remark , why no one curb them and they , moreover , can continue to occupy high position , call the wind and rouse the rain among the intelligentsia and in public opinion ?
contact " southern newspaper ", which be temporarily fierce a short while ago , i feel that part of the intellectual elite have possibly sunk together with media personality !
i remember , 60 @-@ some year ago the us have just fight a war with china , and still threaten china with the use of nuclear weapon ;
40 @-@ some year ago , the us enter vietnam with the intention of contain china ;
although 32 year ago it have establish relation with china , 22 year ago it again start impose sanction on china , 12 year ago it bomb a chinese embassy , 10 year ago the south china sea collision incident occur , and two year ago it restarted its containment of china with great fanfare .
i do n't understand , why be we chinese so forgetful ?
why be there still so many people ignore their conscience and speak on the behalf of the us ?
without take a big loss , people do n't improve their ability to remember - this be possibly the greatest weakness of us chinese .
therefore , it also stand to reason that the force of the traitor of china be rampage and the fifth column be run rampant
it 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise " traitor to china " among primary school student ?
it 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise " traitor to china " among primary school student ?

a form of asbestos once use to make kent cigarette filter have cause a high percentage of cancer death among a group of worker expose to it more than 30 year ago , researcher report .
the asbestos fiber , crocidolite , be unusually resilient once it enter the lung , with even brief exposure to it cause symptom that show up decade later , researcher say .
lorillard inc. , the unit of new york - based loews corp. that make kent cigarette , stop use crocidolite in its micronite cigarette filter in 1956 .
although preliminary finding be report more than a year ago , the latest result appear in today 's new england journal of medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem .
a lorillard spokewoman say , `` this be an old story .
we 're talk about year ago before anyone hear of asbestos have any questionable property .
there be no asbestos in our product now . ''
neither lorillard nor the researcher who study the worker be aware of any research on smoker of the kent cigarette .
`` we have no useful information on whether user be at risk , '' say james a. talcott of boston 's dana - farber cancer institute .
dr. talcott lead a team of researcher from the national cancer institute and the medical school of harvard university and boston university .
the lorillard spokeswoman say asbestos be use in `` very modest amount '' in make paper for the filter in the early 1950 s and replace with a different type of filter in 1956 .
from 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion kent cigarette with the filter be sell , the company say .
among 33 men who work closely with the substance , 28 have die -- more than three time the expect number .
four of the five survive worker have asbestos - related disease , include three with recently diagnose cancer .
the total of 18 death from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis be far higher than expect , the researcher say .
`` the morbidity rate be a striking find among those of us who study asbestos - related disease , '' say dr. talcott .
the percentage of lung cancer death among the worker at the west groton , mass. , paper factory appear to be the highest for any asbestos worker study in western industrialize country , he say .
the plant , which be own by hollingsworth & vose co. , be under contract with lorillard to make the cigarette filter .
the find probably will support those who argue that the u.s. should regulate the class of asbestos include crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , find in most school and other building , dr. talcott say .
the u.s. be one of the few industrialized nation that do n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle - like fibers such as crocidolite that be classify as amphobiles , accord to brooke t. mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the university of vermont college of medicine .
more common chrysotile fibers be curly and be more easily reject by the body , dr. mossman explain .
in july , the environmental protection agency impose a gradual ban on virtually all use of asbestos .
by 1997 , almost all remain use of cancer - cause asbestos will be outlaw .
about 160 worker at a factory that make paper for the kent filter be expose to asbestos in the 1950 s .
area of the factory be particularly dusty where the crocidolite be use .
worker dump large burlap sack of the import material into a huge bin , pour in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mix the dry fibers in a process use to make filter .
worker describe `` cloud of blue dust '' that hung over part of the factory , even though exhaust fan ventilate the area .
`` there 's no question that some of those worker and manager contract asbestos - related disease , '' say darrell phillips , vice president of human resource for hollingsworth & vose .
`` but you have to recognize that these event take place 35 year ago .
it have no bear on our work force today .

when the soviet union collapse in 1991 , partisan of ronald reagan claim he have " won " the cold war .
although a careful review of the fact will show it be not true , the claim be that the soviet union become overextended attempt to keep up with ray @-@ gun 's defense spend .
pappy bush , who be the president at the time , claim that he have win the cold war since the collapse of the soviet union happen on his watch .
regardless of how one view those claim , for many people -- capitalist especially -- herald the " victory " of capitalism .
globalism be hail by its partisan as the natural consequence of their " victory , " and the sensible way to bring the alleged blessing of a problematic freedom to the people of the world .
always impatient of any restaint , capitalist use this so @-@ call victory as justification for the opposition to , or call for the roll @-@ back of any regulatory restraint .
but not everyone have agree with that view of the world and of economic system .
now , with the various " occupy " movement , it be ( or ought to be ) obvious that a great many people be less than enchant with capitalism and its expression in the idustrial democracy , as well as in the country into which capitalist from the industrial democracy go to invest .
what be your thought on capitalism and its activity ?
@setanta , unfettered capitalism have yield an oligarchy .
governmental regulation be good for capitalisms evolution .
health and safety and environmental horror need to be regulate otherwise industry will not ever do whats right for humanity .
@setanta , i do n't have a problem with capitalism -- i have a problem with unregulated capitalism .
i agree with this completely .
capitalism thrive when everyone understand the rule , play by the rule and enforce the rule .
if everyone have to spend all their time try to circumvent the rule , understand the rule or fight against those not follow the rule , that be where trouble really begin .
that 's the problem with " deregulation ".
remove rule do n't help business be more competitive , it mean that business must race to the bottom to counter new business that start there .
it 's like change the rule to monopoly half way through the game so that all the previous purchase be meaningless .
that 's not a benefit to capitalism despite what some would tell you .
out of all of the example i see , the only one i would agree with be the bomb tote arab .
that be extremely rude , though i can see the humor in it .
in a college , that kind of costume should not have a place .
but these kid be list geisha costume , sombrero + donkey , and a few other costume that they deem ' racially insensitive '
racially insensitive ?
have they not be to mexico ?
that be a huge part of their dress when you get farther away from the city .
how be that be insult ?
it be not show someone do something derogatory , it be use the clothe of a society for a costume .
a geisha be insensitive too .
again , ( my opinion only ) this be take it way over board .
sometimes it seem people look for reason to be offend .
it be about perspective frankly .
there will always be someone who see something and want to think the worst of it .
dress in a costume or not dress in one will not change that .
and why be it that only those race @/@ culture be the spotlight of be insensitive ?
be it not just as rude to wear torn over alls , stain shirt , black out your teeth and be a white hillbilly ?
what about the woman who wear short , high heel and too much make up to be a hooker ?
there have to be a stop to this forever drive to find something insensitive .
and if someone want to look for reason they be be hold back for what ever reason they have in their head , they will always find justification no matter what .
but why be we as a so call free society really jump on board this super pc behavior ?
why be it now ok to find the smallest thing to be offend about and throw it out as the new discrimination ?
and why be these rule only apply to two or three race ?
americans , white , black , green , blue , short , tall , fat..
what have you , be all be make fun of in some way when it come to costume and halloween but only those 3 race get the red light ?
isnt that racist ?
these student be bleed idealism and have n't be temper enough with time and cultural patina to realize that one should be able to laugh at oneself and one 's cultural obsession and that these costume be n't the evil mechanism of racism they be betray them to be .
this be an absolutely ridiculous thread .
i mean if racist costume be actually be ban , you all might have a point .
i be as uptight about the plight of white people in the us as anyone be .
but do anyone else read the article ?
no one be ban halloween costumes..
no one be even talk about ban halloween costume .
in fact no one in this story want to ban anything , except for the people here who apparently want to ban poster .
these student have a simple goal .
they say "... if we can change a few people or make a few people think , then that 's awesome ".
they be n't ban anything or stop anybody from do anything .
this story be about student express free speech .
they be make poster express their opinion .
of course if you want to wear a costume that others find offensive it be free speech .
but me complain about your costume be offensive be also free speech .
neither should be ban .
and that be the way it work .
whether your costume involve black face and a noose , or whether it be a grill sandwich where i think the cheese be a little too drippy be irrelevant .
free speech be free speech and express free speech be actually opposite of the " ban " that be be allege .
you all have turn this story on it 's end .
so dear massachusetters , do she have any chance in dethrone the sit republican senator , scott brown ?
why do scott brown need to be dethrone ? i kinda like him...
could elizabeth warren beat scott brown ?
i 'm not sure what either of them look like , but the most brutal fight i ever see be a girl fight , lot of kick , scratch , and some amaze punch ( the loser have to stay home from school for almost a week until swell went down around her eye )
so i 'm gonna say yes
i 'm think in term of the democratic party get one more senate seat .
in massachusetts , it would seem a lot easy task then in other senate race .
i 'm think the best thing to do be keep the few moderate republican we have right where they be .
he may vote along party line for most thing but he 's reasonable when it come to represent a liberal @-@ lean constituency .
do n't know , but it sound like a real bellweather contest , do n't it ?
it would have make for some really great off year contest .
care to explain why you think he be an idiot ?
he do beat martha coakley rather convincingly .
he serve as a state senator for several year .
he even vote for several dem bill .
coakley be a bad candidate who run a terrible campaign - i 'll hunt around for a great article i read a year ago outline the tremendous mistake she make .
as for brown , he have a difficult time answer question about policy in a cogent fashion .
i have see him on several occasion give answer which show that he have no real understand of the underlie issue at all , and several which be really just embarrass .
i have n't really be active in ( or even really care about ) politics until recently and i 'm really just look for other people opinion on this .
well , just tell you who i 'll vote for probably won't inform you much though right ?
what issue be important to you ?
obama because i think he have do a good job in most area ; some area he let me down , plus there be no way i would vote for a republican today .
( i have a few time in the past , mostly local )
anyone who be not a republican .
i think the majority of them be the reason this country have become constipate concern everything that be important .
they be willing to throw america under the bus in order to make obama look bad .
ok , " and why " do add a lot , you 're right .
i 'm vote for obama because i think he have do a good job in difficult circumstance , and can do much more with another term , and because i really worry about what any of the possible republican nominee would do as president if one of them win .
i also would n't vote for just about any republican ( especially rick perry ) but i have hear some good thing about ron paul , he 's about the only republican that i 'm actually interested in learn more about .
my own opinion of ron paul be that i 'm happy that he 's in the race , and especially in debate .
i like how he 's anti @-@ war and anti @-@ bullshit in general .
i would absolutely not want him to be president , though .
andrew sullivan have a lot of post on him , that might be a good place to start if you 're interested in learn more .
here 's his un @-@ endorsement of ron paul ( he endorse him , then have second thought ):
i read a fascinate piece in the wsj today .
the author spoke about how obama 's approval rating be at a dismal low .
he apparently appear to be unable to pull congress together to accomplish much , and in the author 's opinion , it would only get worse if he get elect to a second term .
he would like obama to bow out for a 2 nd term , and have hillary clinton run for president .
he believe that hillary have the best chance of bring the country together .
i do n't know how she feel about run , but , imo , i think that it be a great idea .
she certainly have the smart , the experience , and the approval of the majority of citizen .
i think that the people on the republican side of the fence , be a poor bunch .
there be not a one in the bunch who would capture the imagination of the american people .
the voter who will decide this election , imo be the moderate and the independent . they certainly will not vote for any of the anti @-@ gay , pro @-@ life bible banger .
what do you think ?
should obama step down for the good of the country ?
should hillary run ?
hillary 's time have come , and gone...
she would make her self no friend of the democratic party by divide them and lose the black vote...
no one be go to vote for her that do not vote for mr. obama , and a whole lot less obama voter will vote for her...
do n't worry though..
she have enough sense to not try to run against a sit president from her own party...
best case scenario : obama get reelected and the country continue to slide backwards even if the democrat gain a greater foothold of the us senate and increase their collective mass in the us congress .
worst case scenario : george w. bush ii ( any republican candidate other then huntsman , romney , or ron paul ) will take the election .
then that mean the republican would likely further gain in congress and even the senate perhaps .
then the country slide right back into the deepest of recession .
i suspect you be wrong on the vote inclination of the moderate , and especially the one you call tea baggers .
actually , i think you be wrong on the moderate @/@ independent voter turnout , too , but i could be wrong .
i 'm expect a fairly good anti obama turnout amongst that group .
i could accept hillary .
like phoenix , i 'm not greatly impress by the republican field .
not crazy about the presume democratic candidate either .
on the other hand , obama step aside seem even less likely than cain give up .
i guess that in summary , i 'm not optimistic about the future of the country for the next five year .
kudos to ny ! . they realize that it 's not about just vote the party line , it 's about vote for what 's right .
@jcboy , did they actually vote for gay marriage yet ?
i 'm get a mix message with the ny time
@tsarstepan , they sure do !
hopefully , other state will realize gay marriage hurt nobody .
look at massachusetts . they have have it since 2004 .
have you hear of their society fall apart ? of course not .
i think with ny , then ca , it will rapidly spread across the country .
you can n't stop this train !
@jcboy , i hope that the us congress address this issue soon and just make the whole state by state journey moot by make same sex marriage a national law .
@jcboy , you be correct .
whether one 's home state will recognize a same sex marriage from out of state be another matter .
when i study the domestic relation law of ny , i think it be a damn indignity for a government to give permission to citizen to marry .
the citizen create the damn government , their child . david
did you guy hear about that plane crash that crash into a helicopter ?
i have no idea how that happen .
what do you think ?
that be a congest airway , and when you fly under 1000 feet you have no aid from air traffic controller .

my husband , our kid , and myself be spend a day out by the oceanside with another couple and their kid , our long @-@ time friend .
at some point we come across a huge fallen tree , and our friend l. climb on it and start walk up .
our 11 year @-@ old son follow him , but l. suddenly realize they won't be able to get down that easily .
he turn back and ask our son to get away and down to give him room to get down , too .
our son stop but do n't get out of his way at once .
he be have fun , and we have to tell him 2 more time , and then he obey .
after that l. get back down , and he suddenly grab our son from behind and throw him on the ground with all his might , yell at him .
we be stupefy .
a 215 lbs 38 year old man could have easily injure him .
fortunately he get up unscathed albeit very frighten .
we be in deep shock , we never hit our children .
do anybody know if there be legal way to teach the man a lesson - but not monetary ?
be there any point in file a police report ?
personally , if someone be my friend , i be go to deal with the situation on a person to person level .
why can n't you make it sure that you be really upset and that you do n't want them hit your kid ever again .
legally , there be two remedy .
there be monetary damage , and there be jail time .
i suppose you could add probation ( but that be just a replacement for jail time ) .
if you go the legal route , that pretty much end the friendship no matter what happen .
if i be angry enough to start down this path i would n't worry about where it end up .
i would probably express my feeling on the situation and make it clear that it be not to happen again .
your son be assault .
that be what the behaviour of your ex @-@ friend would be name legally .
he do n't hurt your child physically , so it be the lesser form of assault ( assault cause physical harm be see as more serious.)
you certainly could file a police report....
i do n't know the law where you be , here , it be quite likely that police would go around and question the man , make it clear that ( if your description be accurate ) he have commit an offence , but you could decide against file charge .
again , depending on where you live , you could likely notyify child protection authority .
here , be extra @-@ familial , and give that you have already decide not to expose your child to hm again , they would simply hand it to police .
if you release a legal genie from the bottle , though , you lose control of what the genie do .
for instance , you and your son would need to make a formal statement .
it might be that police act even if you do n't want them to .
it might go to court .
i 'd personally not choose to do it tthat way...though you could certainly chat to local police without name name and see if there be such a thing as a stern chat , or a formal caution to be have in your area .
i 'd hope that a stern talk from you and the loss of the friendship would be a big message to him .
however , my concern would be how he treat his own kid .
that be one hell of an over @-@ reaction .
if you have evidence that he assault his own kid , i 'd be consider a chold protection notification .
be your kid ok ?
that would have be scary .
be he have nightmare or anything ?
i 'd also be have a chat with him about his behaviour .
it do n't warrant such a reaction , but he be thoughtless .
if it be really unusual behaviour from your friend , i be a bit worry about him , too , frankly .
i be a 25 year old woman , and i have be in a 2 year relationship with a 37 year old married man .
he have 2 kid one , from his marriage and one from a previous relationship .
he have be plan to get a divorce since the first day we meet ,
thing be so heat between us , i do n't know what to do .
he be plan on move out of the house by the end of the year , he and his wife do not see eye to eye .
he be have sex chat with a lady he meet on facebook from sweden ,
when i find out it affect me really badly .
i feel and still feel betray and i can n't trust him .
how do i let go ?
@jeje , you just walk away .
do you really think so little of yourself that you believe this be the best you can do ?
a marry man who if he really be in love with you would just go ahead and file for divorce now , or at least move out of his house now .
a man who while have a relationship with you be involve in sex chat online with others .
personally , when you mess with a married man you deserve exactly what you get .
i have little or no pity for you .
but , you can do yourself a world of good by just walk away from him .
then why do n't you think about look for someone who be not attach .
your odds of find happiness be a bit better go that route in my opinion .
