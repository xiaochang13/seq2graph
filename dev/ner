Freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things , 
What is more they are considered traitors of [LOC China] , which is a fact of cultural tyranny in the cloak of nationalism and patriotism . 
In fact , the [LOC US] no longer needs to use force to deal with [LOC China] , they have achieved the result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting " . 
Is the article too intense , is the [LOC United States] so good ? 
If things are not seen by eyes and heard by ears yourself , do not assume their existence , three people create a tiger .

There are so many traitors in the history of [LOC China] - we need to be vigilant . 
With the chaos in [LOC East and] [LOC North Africa] , we also had no choice but to prevent the running dog traitors from colluding with [MISC Western] imperialism . 
Everything has its set number , it 's not time for a change in the weather in [LOC China] , traitors can only bark madly like dogs and nothing else , can only make them disappointed . 
It won't be long until people are coming from all directions to the [MISC Chinese] court . Leading the world . This is the intent of heaven . 
Following with interest . 
This just is a specialty of modern [LOC China] there 's nothing we can do 
There are too many traitors among our compatriots , 
Freedom of speech is relative . We need take national conditions into account . 
Freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,

In fact , [LOC US] no longer needs to use force to deal with [LOC China] , they have reached a result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting " .. . 
Yes . There are many slaves of foreigners . It 's time we should renovate ! 
The ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of [LOC China] ! Comrade [PER Deng Xiaoping] once said that the [ORG Communist Party] will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself . Former [LOC US] Ambassador to [LOC China] Mr. [PER Huntsman] once said in a speech in the [LOC US:] we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in [LOC China] , let the [MISC Chinese] themselves topple [LOC China] - and the [ORG CIA] then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so-called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsiders use us . 
I have reasons to say this: these last several days I have seen the suggestions given by the experts - with a glimpse I see they are disciples of [PER Wang Jingwei] ! 
[MISC Western] society allows these people to see the dawn of fairness and justice of democracy . 
The domestic political development is truly too slow , being criticized by people whose ideology is a bit advanced is inevitable . Can we blame others for this ? 
Saying that someone is bribed is improper ? 
People are all selfish , reality also is often gray . 
Some propaganda activities of [ORG ZF] have soon become viewed as jokes by the people . 
In this environment , what 's wrong if they criticize the previous stupefying propaganda a bit ? 
We can't look over the old accounts of the previous so-called anti-Japanese war . 
Take a look at [LOC North Korea] , that 's our country many years ago . Take a look at their ridiculous propaganda . 
The [LOC United States'] dream of occupying the whole world has never stopped , it is constantly being planned . 
These days , there 's a kind of feeling that 's more and more intense: It 's that [LOC America] , through long-term bribing of the [MISC Chinese] intellectual elite has already succeeded in setting up a " fifth column " . 
These people may consider themselves to be culture celebrities or may be of high authority and important position , and are distributed in various circles in society , taking great pains to promote [MISC American] values* and brainwash the [MISC Chinese] people on behalf of the [MISC Americans] . 
Why is this kind of feeling getting more and more intense ? 
Because these days , I 've been reading part of the " Specialist Professor " blog , it would have been okay if I didn't read it , but after I read it , it made me really surprised . 
For example , Assistant Professor [PER Zhang Ming] of [ORG Renmin University] , the political intentions of many of his blogs are extremely obvious . 
Such as , in one blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in [LOC China] to elementary school textbooks having " [PER Wang Erxiao] " , and he disparaged good articles that promote patriotism as not even worth a penny . 
Another example is so-called " sexologist " and " social activist " [PER Li Yinhe] - one , her stuff is not similar to things like the treatise " [ORG Haite Sexology Report] " ; two , she has no deep thought ; and three , she has no significant contributions . 
She main relies on doing something novel and different and on shocking viewpoints to attract people 's eyes , but without real ability or learning , she 's purely a jumping clown , 
This kind of person puts on the big " specialist " hat just to intimidate people ; the key is that she is concerned about politics yet doesn't understand politics , is willing to be a slave of foreigners yet is arrogant and overbearing , is ignorant yet feels fine . 
Like in the essay " A bit less hostility , a bit more harmony " , she completely denigrates class struggle and the anti-pornography-and-illegal-publications drive as social hostility ; 
in the essay " [LOC China] has already become the country which worships money most on the earth " , she attributes [MISC Chinese] society 's worship of money to atheism ; 
the essay " Are you studying [PER Paul] or studying [PER Bill] ? " , she blathers that " people who study [PER Paul] will become terrorists " ; 
in the essay " Recommendation for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic products " , she takes citizens publishing pornographic novels to be freedom of speech , and says the [LOC Beijing] anti-pornography drive is unconstitutional behavior , etc . 
Especially today 's masterpiece , " Why is it worth paying such close attention to the [MISC Jianghe] obscene goods case ? " , where she is once again crying foul over several people suspected of involvement in erotic business activities who are being dealt with by [LOC Beijing City] , as well as detailing a list of erotic products , with a deeper intent of doing publicity for other people . " 
But these kind of jerky articles actually being put on top by [PER Sina] blog is really preposterous ! 
And there is also [MISC Sichuanese] poet [PER Liu Shahe] , who , while [LOC America] clear to the eye and with swelling gall engages in containment of [LOC China] and the people of the whole nation are feeling indignant , actually comes out with the fallacy " [LOC China] and [LOC America] are friendly " , and tries to pour spirit-confusing soup on the [MISC Chinese] people willfully and without fear ; 
[PER Yi Zhongtian] , who got famous by remarking upon the " three countries " , whose talent and learning I have always respected , but I didn't expect that he was actually supporting the big traitor of [LOC China] , [PER Mao Yushi] , saying some things like " I believe whoever disrespects [PER Mao Yushi] is not human " , once again making me very much drop my glasses ! 
Also , as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago " Complete notes on 100 [MISC Chinese] celebrities who accepted political contributions from the [ORG Ford Foundation] " , I feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in [LOC China] who are " becoming treasonous " are increasingly ardent and have already become willful and without fear , to a level of publicly harming the country . 
But I do not understand , when these people frequently make treasonous remarks , why no one curbs them and they , moreover , can continue to occupy high positions , calling the wind and rousing the rain among the intelligentsia and in public opinion ? 
Contacting " [LOC Southern] newspapers " , which were temporarily fierce a short while ago , I feel that part of the intellectual elite have possibly sunk together with media personalities ! 
I remember , 60-some years ago the [LOC US] had just fought a war with [LOC China] , and still threatened [LOC China] with the use of nuclear weapons ; 
40-some years ago , the [LOC US] entered [LOC Vietnam] with the intention of containing [LOC China] ; 
although 32 years ago it had established relations with [LOC China] , 22 years ago it again started imposing sanctions on [LOC China] , 12 years ago it bombed a [MISC Chinese] embassy , 10 years ago the [LOC South China] Sea collision incident occurred , and two years ago it restarted its containment of [LOC China] with great fanfare . 
I don't understand , why are we [MISC Chinese] so forgetful ? 
Why are there still so many people ignoring their conscience and speaking on the behalf of the [LOC US] ? 
Without taking a big loss , people don't improve their abilities to remember - this is possibly the greatest weakness of us [MISC Chinese] . 
Therefore , it also stands to reason that the forces of the traitors of [LOC China] are rampaging and the fifth column is running rampant 
It 's entirely possible - don't we ourselves raise " traitors to [LOC China] " among primary school students ? 
It 's entirely possible - don't we ourselves raise " traitors to [LOC China] " among primary school students ?

A form of asbestos once used to make [ORG Kent] cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported . 
The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said . 
[ORG Lorillard Inc.] , the unit of [LOC New York] - based [ORG Loews Corp.] that makes [ORG Kent] cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 . 
Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's [LOC New England] Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem . 
A Lorillard spokewoman said , " This is an old story . 
We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties . 
There is no asbestos in our products now . " 
Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the [ORG Kent] cigarettes . 
" We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , " said [PER James A. Talcott] of [LOC Boston] 's [ORG Dana] - [ORG Farber Cancer Institute] . 
Dr. [PER Talcott] led a team of researchers from the [ORG National Cancer Institute] and the medical schools of [ORG Harvard University] and [ORG Boston University] . 
The [ORG Lorillard] spokeswoman said asbestos was used in " very modest amounts " in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 . 
From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion [ORG Kent] cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said . 
Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number . 
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos - related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer . 
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected , the researchers said . 
" The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos - related diseases , " said Dr. [LOC Talcott] . 
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the [LOC West Groton] , [LOC Mass.] , paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in [LOC Western] industrialized countries , he said . 
The plant , which is owned by [ORG Hollingsworth & Vose Co.] , was under contract with [ORG Lorillard] to make the cigarette filters . 
The finding probably will support those who argue that the [LOC U.S.] should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. [PER Talcott] said . 
The [LOC U.S.] is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle - like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to [PER Brooke T. Mossman] , a professor of pathlogy at the [ORG University of Vermont] College of Medicine . 
More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , Dr. [PER Mossman] explained . 
In July , the [ORG Environmental Protection Agency] imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos . 
By 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer - causing asbestos will be outlawed . 
About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the [ORG Kent] filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s . 
Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used . 
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters . 
Workers described " clouds of blue dust " that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area . 
" There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos - related diseases , " said [PER Darrell Phillips] , vice president of human resources for [ORG Hollingsworth & Vose] . 
" But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago . 
It has no bearing on our work force today . 
Yields on money - market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates . 
The average seven - day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by [ORG IBC] 's [ORG Money Fund Report] eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45 % from 8.47 % for the week ended Tuesday . 
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year . 
Average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days , the longest since early August , according to [PER Donoghue] 's . 
Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period . 
Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner . 
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days . 
Nevertheless , said [PER Brenda Malizia Negus] , editor of [ORG Money Fund Report] , yields " may blip up again before they blip down " because of recent rises in short - term interest rates . 
The yield on six - month [ORG Treasury] bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % . 
Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds . 
Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion during the latest week , to $ 352.7 billion . 
Typically , money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates . 
The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9 % . 
[MISC Dreyfus World] - [MISC Wide Dollar] , the top - yielding fund , had a seven - day compound yield of 9.37 % during the latest week , down from 9.45 % a week earlier . 
It invests heavily in dollar - denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which boosts its yield . 
The average seven - day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12 % , down from 8.14 % . 
The 30 - day simple yield fell to an average 8.19 % from 8.22 % ; the 30 - day compound yield slid to an average 8.53 % from 8.56 % .

Until [ORG Congress] acts , the government has n't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind , the [ORG Treasury] said . 
The government 's borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday to $ 2.80 trillion from $ 2.87 trillion . 
Legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes . 
The [LOC House] has voted to raise the ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion , but the [ORG Senate] is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest . 
The [ORG Treasury] said the [LOC U.S.] will default on Nov. 9 if [ORG Congress] does n't act by then .

When it 's time for their biannual powwow , the nation 's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like [LOC Boca Raton] and [LOC Hot Springs] . 
Not this year . 
[ORG The National Association of Manufacturers] settled on the [MISC Hoosier] capital of [LOC Indianapolis] for its fall board meeting . 
And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners . 
The idea , of course : to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the [ORG Rust Belt] is n't so rusty after all , that it 's a good place for a company to expand . 
On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like [LOC Du Pont] and [ORG Maytag] , along with lesser knowns like [ORG Trojan Steel] and the [ORG Valley Queen Cheese Factory] . 
For starters , the executives joined Mayor [PER William H. Hudnut III] for an evening of the [LOC Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra] and a guest pianist - comedian [PER Victor Borge] . 
Champagne and dessert followed . 
The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the [ORG Indianapolis Motor Speedway] , unimpeded by traffic or red lights . 
The governor could n't make it , so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests . 
A buffet breakfast was held in the museum , where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors . 
Then , in the guests ' honor , the speedway hauled out four drivers , crews and even the official [LOC Indianapolis] 500 announcer for a 10 - lap exhibition race . 
After the race , [ORG Fortune 500] executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers . 
No dummies , the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two . 
Back downtown , the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again . 
This time , it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away . 
Under the stars and moons of the renovated [LOC Indiana] Roof ballroom , nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them [LOC Indiana] duckling mousseline , lobster consomme , veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce . 
Knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one , the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation . 
More than a few CEOs say the red - carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings . 
But for now , they 're looking forward to their winter meeting -- [LOC Boca] in February . 
[LOC South Korea] registered a trade deficit of $ 101 million in October , reflecting the country 's economic sluggishness , according to government figures released Wednesday . 
Preliminary tallies by the [ORG Trade and Industry Ministry] showed another trade deficit in October , the fifth monthly setback this year , casting a cloud on [LOC South Korea] 's export - oriented economy . 
Exports in October stood at $ 5.29 billion , a mere 0.7 % increase from a year earlier , while imports increased sharply to $ 5.39 billion , up 20 % from last October . 
[LOC South Korea] 's economic boom , which began in 1986 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports . 
Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion . 
Despite the gloomy forecast , [LOC South Korea] has recorded a trade surplus of $ 71 million so far this year . 
From January to October , the nation 's accumulated exports increased 4 % from the same period last year to $ 50.45 billion . 
Imports were at $ 50.38 billion , up 19 % . 
[ORG Newsweek] , trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers . 
The new ad plan from [ORG Newsweek] , a unit of the [ORG Washington Post Co.] , is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years . 
Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between [ORG Newsweek] , [ORG Time Warner Inc] . 's Time magazine , and [PER Mortimer B. Zuckerman] 's [ORG U.S. News & World Report] .

A full , four - color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 . 
When the [LOC Soviet Union] collapsed in 1991 , partisans of [PER Ronald Reagan] claimed he had " won " the cold war . 
Although a careful review of the facts will show it was not true , the claim was that the [LOC Soviet Union] became overextended attempting to keep up with [PER Ray-gun] 's defense spending . 
[PER Pappy Bush] , who was the president at the time , claimed that he had won the cold war since the collapse of the [LOC Soviet Union] happened on his watch . 
Regardless of how one views those claims , for many people -- capitalists especially -- heralded the " victory " of capitalism . 
Globalism was hailed by its partisans as the natural consequence of their " victory , " and the sensible way to bring the alleged blessings of a problematic freedom to the people of the world . 
Always impatient of any restaint , capitalists used this so-called victory as justification for the opposition to , or calls for the roll-back of any regulatory restraint . 
But not everyone has agreed with that view of the world and of economic systems . 
Now , with the various " Occupy " movements , it is ( or ought to be ) obvious that a great many people are less than enchanted with capitalism and its expression in the idustrial democracies , as well as in the countries into which capitalists from the industrial democracies go to invest . 
What are your thoughts on capitalism and its activities ? 
@Setanta , Unfettered capitalism has yielded an Oligarchy . 
Governmental regulation is good for capitalisms evolution . 
Health and safety and environmental horrors need to be regulated otherwise industries will not EVER do whats right for humanity . 
@Setanta , I don't have a problem with capitalism -- i have a problem with unregulated capitalism . 
I agree with this completely . 
Capitalism thrives when everyone understands the rules , plays by the rules and enforces the rules . 
If everyone has to spend all their time trying to circumvent the rules , understand the rules or fighting against those not following the rules , that is where trouble really begins . 
That 's the problem with " deregulation " . 
Removing rules doesn't help business be more competitive , it means that businesses must race to the bottom to counter new businesses that start there . 
It 's like changing the rules to Monopoly half way through the game so that all the previous purchases are meaningless . 
That 's not a benefit to capitalism despite what some would tell you . 
Out of all of the examples I saw , the only one I would agree with is the bomb toting [MISC Arab] . 
That is extremely rude , though I can see the humor in it . 
In a college , that kind of costume should not have a place . 
But these kids are listing Geisha costumes , sombreros + donkeys , and a few other costumes that they deem 'racially insensitive' 
Racially insensitive ? 
Have they not been to [LOC Mexico] ? 
That is a huge part of their dress when you get farther away from the cities . 
How is that being insulting ? 
It is not showing someone doing something derogatory , it is using the clothes of a society for a costume . 
A Geisha is insensitive too . 
Again , ( my opinion only ) this is taking it way over board . 
Sometimes it seems people look for reasons to be offended . 
It is about perspective frankly . 
There will ALWAYS be someone who sees something and wants to think the worst of it . 
Dressing in a costume or NOT dressing in one will not change that . 
And why is it that only those races/cultures are the spotlight of being insensitive ? 
Is it not JUST as rude to wear torn over alls , stained shirt , black out your teeth and be a white hillbilly ? 
What about the woman who wears shorts , high heels and too much make up to be a hooker ? 
There has to be a stop to this forever drive to find something insensitive . 
And if someone wants to look for reasons they are being held back for what ever reason they have in their heads , they will always find justification no matter what . 
But why are we as a so called free society really jumping on board this super PC behavior ? 
Why is it now ok to find the smallest thing to be offended about and throw it out as the new discrimination ? 
And why are these rules only applied to two or three races ? 
[MISC Americans] , white , black , green , blue , short , tall , fat. . 
what have you , are ALL being made fun of in some way when it comes to costumes and halloween but only those 3 races get the red light ? 
Isnt THAT racist ? 
These students are bleeding idealism and haven't been tempered enough with time and cultural patina to realize that one should be able to laugh at oneself and one 's cultural obsessions and that these costumes aren't the evil mechanisms of racism they are betraying them to be . 
This is an absolutely ridiculous thread . 
I mean if racist costumes were actually being banned , you all might have a point . 
I am as uptight about the plight of white people in the [LOC US] as anyone is . 
But did anyone else read the article ? 
No one is banning [MISC Halloween] costumes. . 
No one is even talking about banning Halloween costumes . 
In fact no one in this story wants to ban anything , except for the people here who apparently want to ban posters . 
These students have a simple goal . 
They say " ... if we can change a few people or make a few people think , then that 's awesome " . 
They aren't banning anything or stopping anybody from doing anything . 
This story is about students expressing free speech . 
They are making posters expressing their opinion . 
Of course if you want to wear a costume that others find offensive it is free speech . 
But me complaining about your costume being offensive is also free speech . 
Neither should be banned . 
And that is the way it works . 
Whether your costume involves black face and a noose , or whether it is a grilled sandwich where I think the cheese is a little too drippy is irrelevant . 
Free speech is free speech and expressing free speech is actually opposite of the " banning " that is being alleged . 
You all have turned this story on it 's end . 
SO dear Massachusetters , does she have any chance in dethroning the sitting [MISC Republican] Senator , [PER Scott Brown] ? 
Why does [PER Scott Brown] need to be dethroned ? I kinda like him.. . 
Could [PER Elizabeth Warren] beat [PER Scott Brown] ? 
i 'm not sure what either of them look like , but the most brutal fight i ever saw was a girl fight , lots of kicking , scratching , and some amazing punches ( the loser had to stay home from school for almost a week until swelling went down around her eyes ) 
so i 'm gonna say yes 
I 'm thinking in terms of the [ORG Democratic Party] getting one more [ORG Senate] seat . 
In [LOC Massachusetts] , it would seem a lot easier task then in other [ORG Senate] races . 
I 'm thinking the best thing to do is keep the few moderate [MISC Republicans] we have right where they are . 
He may vote along party lines for most things but he 's reasonable when it comes to representing a liberal-leaning constituency . 
Don't know , but it sounds like a real bellweather contest , doesn't it ? 
It would have made for some really great off year contest . 
Care to explain why you think he is an idiot ? 
He did beat [PER Martha Coakley] rather convincingly . 
He served as a State Senator for several years . 
He even voted for several [MISC Dem] bills . 
[PER Coakley] was a bad candidate who ran a terrible campaign - I'll hunt around for a great article I read a year ago outlining the tremendous mistakes she made . 
As for [PER Brown] , he has a difficult time answering questions about policy in a cogent fashion . 
I have seen him on several occasions give answers which show that he has no real understanding of the underlying issue at all , and several which are really just embarrassing . 
I haven't really been active in ( or even really cared about ) politics until recently and I 'm really just looking for other peoples opinions on this . 
Well , just telling you who I'll vote for probably won't inform you much though right ? 
What issues are important to you ? 
[LOC Obama] because I think he has done a good job in most areas ; some areas he let me down , plus there is no way I would vote for a republican today . 
( I have a few times in the past , mostly local ) 
Anyone who is not a [MISC Republican] . 
I think the majority of them are the reason this country has become constipated concerning everything that is important . 
They are willing to throw [LOC America] under the bus in order to make [LOC Obama] look bad . 
[LOC OK] , " and why " does add a lot , you're right . 
I 'm voting for [LOC Obama] because I think he has done a good job in difficult circumstances , and can do much more with another term , and because I really worry about what any of the possible [MISC Republican] nominees would do as president if one of them won . 
I also wouldn't vote for just about any republican ( especially [PER Rick Perry] ) but I have heard some good things about [PER Ron Paul] , he 's about the only republican that I 'm actually interested in learning more about . 
My own opinion of [PER Ron Paul] is that I 'm happy that he 's in the race , and especially in debates . 
I like how he 's anti-war and anti-bullshit in general . 
I would absolutely not want him to be president , though . 
[PER Andrew Sullivan] has a lot of posts on him , that might be a good place to start if you're interested in learning more . 
Here 's his un-endorsement of [PER Ron Paul] ( he endorsed him , then had second thoughts ) : 
I read a fascinating piece in the [ORG WSJ] today . 
The author spoke about how [LOC Obama] 's approval ratings are at a dismal low . 
He apparently appears to be unable to pull [ORG Congress] together to accomplish much , and in the author 's opinion , it would only get worse if he got elected to a second term . 
He would like [LOC Obama] to bow out for a 2nd term , and have [PER Hillary Clinton] run for president . 
He believes that [PER Hillary] has the best chance of bringing the country together . 
I don't know how she feels about running , but , [LOC IMO] , I think that it is a great idea . 
She certainly has the smarts , the experience , and the approval of the majority of citizens . 
I think that the people on the [MISC Republican] side of the fence , are a poor bunch . 
There is not a one in the bunch who would capture the imagination of the [MISC American] people . 
The voters who will decide this election , [LOC IMO] are the moderates and the independents . THEY certainly will not vote for any of the anti-gay , pro-life bible bangers . 
What do you think ? 
Should [LOC Obama] step down for the good of the country ? 
Should [PER Hillary] run ? 
[PER Hillary] 's time has come , and gone.. . 
She would make her self no friend of the [MISC Democratic] party by dividing them and losing the black vote.. . 
No one is going to vote for her that did not vote for Mr. [LOC Obama] , and a whole lot less [LOC Obama] voters will vote for her.. . 
Don't worry though. . 
She has enough sense to not try to run against a sitting president from her own party.. . 
Best case scenario: [LOC Obama] gets reelected and the country continues to slide backwards even if the [MISC Democrats] gain a greater foothold of the [ORG US Senate] and increase their collective mass in the [ORG US Congress] . 
Worst case scenario: [PER George W. Bush] II ( any [MISC Republican] candidate other then [PER Huntsman] , [PER Romney] , or [PER Ron Paul] ) will take the election . 
Then that means the [MISC Republicans] would likely further gain in [ORG Congress] and even the [ORG Senate] perhaps . 
Then the country slides right back into the deepest of recessions . 
I suspect you are wrong on the voting inclinations of the moderates , and especially the ones you call tea baggers . 
Actually , I think you are wrong on the moderate/independent voter turnout , too , but I could be wrong . 
I 'm expecting a fairly good anti [LOC Obama] turnout amongst that group . 
I could accept [PER Hillary] . 
Like [LOC Phoenix] , I 'm not greatly impressed by the [MISC Republican] field . 
Not crazy about the presumed [MISC Democratic] candidate either . 
On the other hand , [LOC Obama] stepping aside seems even less likely than [PER Cain] giving up . 
I guess that in summary , I 'm not optimistic about the future of the country for the next five years . 
Kudos to [LOC NY] ! . They realize that it 's not about just voting the party line , it 's about voting for what 's right . 
@jcboy , Did they actually vote for gay marriage yet ? 
I 'm getting a mixed message with the [ORG NY Times] 
@tsarstepan , They sure did ! 
Hopefully , other states will realize gay marriage hurts nobody . 
Look at [LOC Massachusetts] . They have had it since 2004 . 
Have you heard of their society falling apart ? Of course not . 
I think with [LOC NY] , then [ORG CA] , it will rapidly spread across the country . 
You can't stop this train ! 
@jcboy , I hope that the [ORG US Congress] addresses this issue soon and just makes the whole state by state journey moot by making same sex marriage a national law . 
@jcboy , You are correct . 
Whether one 's home state will recognize a same sex marriage from out of state is another matter . 
When I studied the [ORG Domestic Relations Law of NY] , I thought it was a damned INDIGNITY for a government to give permission to citizens to marry . 
The citizens created the damned government , their child . [PER David] 
Did you guys hear about that plane crash that crashed into a helicopter ? 
I have no idea how that happened . 
What do you think ? 
That is a congested airway , and when you fly under 1000 feet you have no aid from air traffic controllers . 
Accidents happen , but this particular area may need additional regulation ( such as a minimum altitude requirement for the tourist helicopters ) . 
My husband , our kids , and myself were spending a day out by the oceanside with another couple and their kids , our long-time friends . 
At some point we came across a huge fallen tree , and our friend [PER L.] climbed on it and started walking up . 
Our 11 year-old son followed him , but [PER L.] suddenly realized they won't be able to get down that easily . 
He turned back and asked our son to get away and down to give him room to get down , too . 
Our son stopped but didn't get out of his way at once . 
He was having fun , and we had to tell him 2 more times , and then he obeyed . 
After that [PER L.] got back down , and he suddenly grabbed our son from behind and threw him on the ground with all his might , yelling at him . 
We were stupefied . 
A 215lbs 38 year old man could have easily injured him . 
Fortunately he got up unscathed albeit very frightened . 
We are in deep shock , we never hit our children . 
Does anybody know if there are legal ways to teach the man a lesson - but not monetary ? 
Is there any point in filing a police report ? 
Personally , if someone is my friend , I am going to deal with the situation on a person to person level . 
Why can't you make it sure that you were really upset and that you don't want them hitting your kids ever again . 
Legally , there are two remedies . 
There is monetary damages , and there is jail time . 
I suppose you could add probation ( but that is just a replacement for jail time ) . 
If you go the legal route , that pretty much ends the friendship no matter what happens . 
If I was angry enough to start down this path I wouldn't worry about where it ended up . 
I would probably express my feelings on the situation and make it clear that it was not to happen again . 
Your son was assaulted . 
That is what the behaviour of your ex-friend would be named legally . 
He didn't hurt your child physically , so it was the lesser form of assault ( assault causing physical harm is seen as more serious . ) 
You certainly could file a police report... . 
I don't know the law where you are , here , it is quite likely that police would go around and question the man , making it clear that ( if your description is accurate ) he had committed an offence , but you could decide against filing charges . 
Again , depending on where you live , you could likely notyify child protection authorities . 
here , being extra-familial , and given that you have already decided not to expose your child to hm again , they would simply hand it to police . 
If you release a legal genie from the bottle , though , you lose control of what the genie does . 
For instance , you and your son would need to make a formal statement . 
It might be that police act even if you don't want them to . 
It might go to court . 
I 'd personally not choose to do it tthat way...though you could certainly chat to local police without naming names and see if there is such a thing as a stern chat , or a formal caution to be had in your area . 
I 'd hope that a stern talk from you and the loss of the friendship would be a big message to him . 
However , my concern would be how he treats his own kids . 
That was one hell of an over-reaction . 
If you have evidence that he assaults his own kids , I 'd be considering a chold protection notification . 
is your kid ok ? 
That would have been scary . 
Is he having nightmares or anything ? 
I 'd also be having a chat with him about his behaviour . 
It didn't warrant such a reaction , but he was thoughtless . 
If it was really unusual behaviour from your friend , I am a bit worried about him , too , frankly . 
I am a 25 year old woman , and I have been in a 2 year relationship with a 37 year old married man . 
He has 2 kids one , from his marriage and one from a previous relationship . 
He has been planning to get a divorce since the first day we met , 
things are so heated between us , I don't know what to do . 
He is planning on moving out of the house by the end of the year , he and his wife do not see eye to eye . 
He was having sex chats with a lady he met on facebook from [LOC Sweden] , 
when I found out it affected me really badly . 
I felt and still feel betrayed and I can't trust him . 
How do I let go ? 
@JEJE , You just walk away . 
Do you really think so little of yourself that you believe this is the best you can do ? 
A married man who if he really was in love with you would just go ahead and file for divorce now , or at least move out of his house now . 
A man who while having a relationship with you is involved in sex chats online with others . 
Personally , when you mess with a married man you deserve exactly what you get . 
I have little or no pity for you . 
But , you can do yourself a world of good by just walking away from him . 
Then why don't you think about looking for someone who is not attached . 
Your odds of finding happiness are a bit better going that route in my opinion .

[ORG NATO] allies have signed an agreement to fund a research center to bolster defenses against cyber attacks . 
On 14 May 2008 7 [ORG NATO] allies signed an agreement to fund a research center . 
The center will bolster [ORG NATO] 's defenses against cyber attacks . 
The center will be operational in August 2008 . 
The center will formally open in 2009 . 
A staff of 30 specialists will conduct research and training on cyber warfare . 
[ORG NATO] CONSIDERS cyber attacks a growing threat to military and civilian computer networks . 
The research center is based in [LOC Tallinn] , [LOC Estonia] . 
Defense chiefs from [LOC Estonia] , [LOC Latvia] , [LOC Lithuania] , [LOC Germany] , [LOC Italy] , [LOC Spain] and [LOC Slovakia] signed the agreement . 
The agreement will provide staff and funding for the research center . 
In 2007 the [MISC Estonian] Government was struck by cyber attacks . 
The cyber attacks crippled government and corporate computer networks . 
The cyber attacks were unprecedented . 
The cyber attacks followed a dispute over the relocation of a [MISC Soviet] war memorial in [LOC Estonia] 's capital . 
Many suspect the [LOC Kremlin] of the cyber attacks . 
[LOC Russia] denied involvement with the cyber attacks . 
[ORG NATO] 's top commander in charge of military modernization [LOC U.S.] Gen. [PER James Mattis] stated -- 
[ORG NATO] will cooperate to bring together the best minds together in cyber defense . 
[ORG NATO] cannot say that [ORG NATO] will not defend the web that everybody needs . 
The [LOC U.S.] will join the project as an observer .

At a news conference at the research center [MISC Estonian] Defense Minister [PER Jaak Aaviksoo] stated that -- 
Cyber space essentially has no borders . 
It is difficult to defend the sovereignty of land and sea borders and air space . 
It is even more complicated in borderless cyber space where there is no smoking gun , fingerprints or footprints . 
The agreement was signed during a regular meeting of [ORG Chiefs of Defense] Staff from the 26 [ORG NATO] allies .

On 15 May 2008 the Government of [LOC Russia] proposed cooperation with [LOC India] and [LOC China] to increase security around [LOC Afghanistan] in order to block drug supplies . 
[MISC Russian] Foreign Minister [PER Sergey Lavrov] at a joint news conference in [LOC Yekaterinburg] with the foreign ministers of [LOC India] and [LOC China] stated that tightening security at [MISC Afghan] borders would decrease the threat of drugs and terrorism . 
[PER Lavrov] 's intentions were not immediately clear since neither [LOC Russia] nor [LOC India] has a border with [LOC Afghanistan] and [LOC China] 's border with [LOC Afghanistan] is only 76 kilometers ( 45 miles ) . 
[LOC Afghanistan] 's other neighbors are [LOC Iran] , [LOC Turkmenistan] , [LOC Uzbekistan] , [LOC Tajikistan] and [LOC Pakistan] . 
[LOC Afghanistan] is 1 of the world 's major opium producers and supplies [MISC Western] markets through transit countries such as [LOC Russia] .

[MISC Russian] Federation President [PER Dmitry Medvedev] promised on May 15 , 2008 to provide funding for [LOC Russia] 's nuclear missile program . 
[MISC Russian] Federation President [PER Dmitry Medvedev] made a debut on May 15 , 2008 as commander in chief of the [MISC Russian] Federation 's armed forces by touring a missile base and promising to provide the necessary funding for nuclear forces counter global threats . 
[PER Dmitry Medvedev] examined Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles concealed by the military in a dense pine forest and spoke to officers at the base in teikovo . 
[PER Dmitry Medvedev] was impressed by the weapons and the level of training . 
[PER Dmitry Medvedev] also stated that it is good that the military is getting new missiles like the Topol-M . 
Missiles from the base in teikovo took part in the [LOC Victory Day] parade on May 9 , 2008 when [LOC Russia] displayed the country 's military hardware on [LOC Red Square] in [LOC Moscow] for the first time since the [LOC Soviet] collapse . 
[PER Dmitry Medvedev] experienced motivation while watching the missiles across the square and promised that such parades will continue and may be expanded in the future . 
[PER Dmitry Medvedev] stated that the [LOC Russian Federation] 's task for the next few years is to make sure that the [ORG Strategic Missile Forces] receive the necessary funding to respond to modern threats . 
[PER Dmitry Medvedev] also stated that certain progress has been made recently and that the speed of progress must not be lost . 
[PER Dmitry Medvedev] promised to raise officers' salaries . 
[PER Dmitry Medvedev] was sworn in on May 7 , 2008 as the [LOC Russian Federation] 's President and has so far portrayed an image of a liberal and avoided the harsh anti-western rhetoric of [PER Vladimir Putin] . 
[PER Vladimir Putin] was [PER Dmitry Medvedev] 's predecessor and mentor . 
Most observers expect [PER Dmitry Medvedev] to continue the policies of [PER Vladimir Putin] , such as an assertive posture on the international scene and vow to strengthen the military . 
Teikovo is a small town in the [LOC Ivanovo] region about 250 kilometers or 155 miles northeast of [LOC Moscow] . 
[PER Vladimir Putin] fiercely opposed the [LOC United] States' plans to deploy missile defense sites in [LOC Poland] and the [LOC Czech Republic] , and [ORG NATO] 's plans to accept into the alliance [LOC Russia] 's ex-Soviet neighbors , [LOC Ukraine] and [LOC Georgia] . 
[PER Vladimir Putin] has threatened to point nuclear missiles at countries that take part in [LOC U.S.] missile defense and opted out of a key [MISC Soviet] -era arms control treaty . 
Topol-M missiles are capable of hitting targets more than 10000 kilometers or 6000 miles away . 
The missiles are deployed in both silo-based and truck-mounted versions . 
Strategic missiles forces chief General [PER Nikolai Solovtsov] stated that the Topol-M is a new step in missile design . 
[PER Vladimir Putin] and other officials have boasted about the Topol-M 's ability to penetrate any prospective missile defense . 
[PER Yuri solomonov] designed the missile and stated that the missile drops engines at a significantly lower altitude than earlier designs which makes it hard for an enemy 's early warning system to detect the launch . 
[PER Yuri solomonov] stated that the missiles' warhead and decoys closely resemble one another in flight , making it very difficult for a foe to select the real target from a multitude of false ones . 
Deployment of topol=ms has proceeded slowly . 
Large oil revenues in recent years have allowed the Government of the [LOC Russia] Federation to buy weapons and fund the development of new missiles . 
Soviet-built ballistic missiles have remained the backbone of the nation 's nuclear forces . 
The [ORG Navy of the Russian Federation] is in poor shape . 
Soviet-built nuclear submarines frequently need repairs and rarely leave the bases . 
The [PER Yuri] dolgoruky is the first in a series of new nuclear submarines to be commissioned this year but the bulava nuclear-armed missile developed to equip the submarine has failed tests and the deployment prospects are uncertain .

Expert states that [MISC Iranian] missile launch photo was doctored to show failed 4th missile launching . 
20080710 director of the [ORG London] -based [ORG International Institute for Strategic Studies] 's non-proliferation program and former [ORG US State Department] official [PER Mark Fitzpatrick] stated that an [MISC Iranian] photograph showing a cluster of missile launches from a desert range was altered to add a 4th missile . 
The image was posted 20080709 on the [ORG Sepah] news site , which is run by [LOC Iran] 's [ORG Revolutionary Guards] . 
20080710 the image was replaced with an image of the same 3 missiles in the previous photo but in place of the 4th missile is a grounded missile and what appears to be a vehicle nearby . 
20080710 the image with 4 launches was absent from Sepah 's main page but both images were in the archive . 
[PER Fitzpatrick] stated that the photo was probably manipulated to obscure the failure of the 4th missile in order to maintain the impact of [LOC Iran] 's demonstration of power . 
[MISC Iranian] officials did not immediately comment on the photos . 
The image was described as depicting part of military maneuvers in which nine missiles were test fired , including an enhanced version of the Shahab-3 . 
[MISC Iranian] officials stated that the enhanced [MISC Shahab-3] missile has a range of 1250 miles and thus could reach [LOC Israel] and the majority of the [LOC Middle East] . 
The [LOC US] government immediately criticized the missile test .

The Prosecutor General 's Office said in a statement -- 
Prosecutors in southern [LOC Russia] 's [LOC Astrakhan] region across the [LOC Caspian Sea] from [LOC Iran] have sent the case against [ORG ANAR Godzhayev] to court . 
The metal in question is tantalum . 
Tantalum can be used in the production of chemical processing equipment , nuclear reactors and missile parts and is subject to export restrictions under [MISC Russian] law . 
Tantalum powder is a super-grade chemical and can be used in the manufacture of mobile phones , personal computers , motor vehicles and electronics goods . 
Prosecutors have stated that [PER Godzhayev] lied about the contents of an outgoing shipment in customs documents after a business partner asked [PER Godzhayev] to send more than a ton of materials containing tantalum to [LOC Iran] in July 2007 .

A [ORG U.N.] representative stated that the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside [LOC Afghanistan] but that the chemicals needed to complete the conversion are being smuggled into [LOC Afghanistan] from other countries . 
The [ORG U.N.] representative requested the international community share more information on known smugglers of the chemicals . 
The [ORG U.N.] stated on 28 July 2008 that the international community should do more to stop chemicals used to convert opium to heroin from reaching [LOC Afghanistan] and detailed increasing sophistication in [LOC Afghanistan] 's drug trade . 
[LOC Afghanistan] produces more than 90 percent of the world 's opium . 
Opium production in [LOC Afghanistan] has increased since the [MISC U.S.] -led invasion removed the [ORG Taliban] regime in 2001 . 
Officials in the [MISC American] -backed government and [ORG Taliban] militants are believed to profit from the illicit trade . 
[ORG U.N.] figures show [LOC Afghanistan] yielded approximately 9000 tons of opium in 2007 which could create more than 900 tons of heroin . 
[LOC Afghanistan] 's representative for the [ORG U.N. Office] on Drugs and Crime [PER Christina Oguz] stated the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside [LOC Afghanistan] mostly at laboratories in the border regions in the insurgency-plagued [LOC South] and the [LOC East .] 
[LOC Oguz] stated to reporters in [LOC Kabul] that evidence of higher quality [MISC Afghan] heroin indicates that the people running the labs are getting assistance from chemists who have come from outside the country as foreign consultants . 
[LOC Oguz] stated the chemists originated from countries near the border but did not detail specific countries . 
[LOC Oguz] stated the chemicals needed to make the heroin were being smuggled from [LOC China] , [LOC South Korea] , [MISC European] countries , including [LOC Russia] , and other parts of the world . 
[LOC Oguz] stated the so-called precursor chemicals such as acetic anhydride also have legal uses including in the paint and pharmaceutical industries . 
[LOC Oguz] stated the chemicals often are legally exported but later diverted to [LOC Afghanistan] for illicit goals and [LOC Afghanistan] has no major legal industries that would require such chemicals . 
[LOC Oguz] stated -- 
Blaming [LOC Afghanistan] alone for the heroin problem in the world is not correct . 
[LOC Afghanistan] does produce the opium which is the raw material for heroin but it is not possible to make heroin without certain chemicals that are not produced inside [LOC Afghanistan] and are smuggled into [LOC Afghanistan] . 
More than 200 tons of the chemicals have been seized by [MISC Afghan] authorities since 2006 but some 13000 tons were needed based on 2007 's opium production figures . 
The figures suggest the confiscated amount represented a small fraction of the total smuggled in . 
Most seizures of the chemicals occur along the eastern border with [LOC Pakistan] but a good deal comes via the western border with [LOC Iran] . 
[LOC Oguz] stated the international community should share more information on known smugglers of the chemicals who were long-established and based in [LOC Afghanistan] 's neighboring countries . 
[MISC Western] officials are increasingly concerned that [ORG Taliban] militants are bankrolling the insurgency through the drug trade . 
The [ORG U.N.] briefing comes in the wake of allegations that [MISC Afghan] President [PER Hamid Karzai] protected drug lords for political reasons . 
A former senior [ORG U.S. State Department] counter-narcotics official wrote in an article in the 27 July 2008 issue of [ORG New York Times] magazine that narco-corruption went to the top of the [MISC Afghan] Government . 
The official alleged [ORG Karzai] was reluctant to move against big drug lords in [ORG Karzai] 's political power base in the south of [LOC Afghanistan] where most opium is produced . 
[PER Karzai] has stated commitment to eliminating corruption and battling the drug trade . 
[LOC Oguz] stated on 28 July 2008 that corruption exists within the system but [LOC Afghanistan] lacked a well-trained police force for many years and officials are only now taking steps in fighting corruption .

[MISC Estonian] informatics center spokeswoman [PER Katrin pargmae] stated that hosting websites in different countries makes the websites more complicated and time-consuming for hackers to disrupt .

[ORG The European Union] 's highest court on September 3 , 2008 overturned a verdict to freeze the assets of multiple individuals and groups accused of funding terrorist organizations . 
[ORG The] [ORG European Union] 's highest court on September 3 , 2008 overturned a 2001 decision by [ORG European Union] governments to freeze the assets of a [MISC Saudi] businessman and a [MISC Sweden] -based charity suspected of funding Al-Qaida terror groups . 
The ruling conflicts with a [ORG United Nations] anti-terror order obliging [ORG United Nations] Member States to freeze assets of people and entities suspected of funding terror groups . 
[ORG The European Union] 's highest court also stated that the [ORG United Nations] order failed to offer individuals on a terror blacklist or individuals on the defense any legal rights to a judicial review under [MISC European] law . 
[ORG The European Union] 's highest court acknowledged that the reasons for freezing the assets of [PER Yasin Al-Qadi] and the [ORG Al-Barakaat International Foundation] may be justified . 
It is not known whether [ORG European Union] nations which have set up a joint terror blacklist will unfreeze the assets . 
None of the groups have so far been officially removed from the blacklist because [ORG European Union] Governments argue the court rulings do not oblige the [ORG European Union] nations to remove the names from the list but only force the [ORG European Union] to inform the individuals and groups on the list that the assets have been frozen . 
Head of the [ORG Saudi] -based [MISC Muwafaq Foundation] [PER Yasin Al-Qadi] appealed against the [ORG European Union] 's decision to freeze proprietary assets . 
[LOC United States] Treasury officials allege the [ORG Muwafaq Foundation] is an al-Qaida Front used to funnel millions of dollars and euros to al-Qaida . 
[ORG Al-Barakaat International] appealed the [ORG European Union] 's decision to freeze 1 million [MISC Swedish] kroner or 152247 [LOC United States] dollars . 
Lawyers for [ORG Al-Barakaat International] stated that the money was being used to fund aid programs for families in [LOC Somalia] . 
[PER Thomas Olsson] stated that the lawyers for [ORG Al-Barakaat International] would now examine ways of having the assets released to the [MISC Somali] immigrants in [LOC Sweden] who used the network to send funds to relatives in [LOC Somalia] . 
[PER Thomas Olsson] also stated that the lawyers for [ORG Al-Barakaat International] have to examine the judicial consequences of the verdict as the sanctions remain on a [ORG United Nations] level . 
[ORG The European Union] 's highest court stated on September 3 , 2008 that the 27-nation [ORG European Union] is required to inform any person whose assets are being frozen why as swiftly as possible after the decision is taken in order to allow the person with frozen assets the right to legal recourse . 
[MISC Swedish] lawyer [PER Thomas Olsson] who represented [PER Al-Barakaat] in the case approved of the ruling . 
This ruling may hinder international efforts to stop the financing of terror groups including al-Qaida . 
The ruling overturns an earlier 2005 [ORG European Union] court decision that rejected the appeals of [PER Al-Qadi] and the [MISC Al-Barakaat] international foundation . 
The ruling stated that the lower [ORG European Union] 's court judgment erred in law by stating that [ORG European Union] courts had no jurisdiction to review the legality of the contested order to freeze assets of individuals and groups deemed to be funding terror groups by the [ORG United Nations] . 
Other suspects and groups on an [ORG European Union] terror blacklist have also won legal victories for similar reasons against being listed . 
These suspects and groups have so far not had assets unfrozen or names removed from the [ORG European Union] 's blacklist . 
[ORG The] [ORG European Union] 's High Court had previously overturned an [ORG European Union] decision to freeze the assets of the People 's [LOC Mujahadeen of] [LOC Iran] . 
[ORG The People 's Mujahadeen of] [LOC Iran] is an exiled [MISC Iranian] Resistance movement that is on the [ORG European Union] 's terror blacklist . 
[ORG The European Union] 's High Court recently overturned a decision to freeze the assets of an exiled [LOC Philippine] rebel leader and the [MISC Netherlands] -based [ORG Al-Aqsa Foundation] because the leader and group were not informed why the assets were frozen which is a breach of [ORG EU] law .

[MISC Swedish] Prosecutor [PER Ronnie Jacobsson] stated on September 9 , 2008 that charges will not be pressed against the 3 [MISC Swedes] arrested on suspicion of funding terrorism earlier in 2008 . 
The charges are being dropped because [PER Ronnie] jaccobson cannot provide that the men had intended to send money to terrorist organizations . 
The [MISC Swedes] were accused of using the informal money transfer networks called hawalas to send funds to alleged terror groups in [LOC Somalia] . 
The 3 [MISC Swedes] were arrested in raids in [LOC Stockholm] in February . 
The raid was coordinated with a crackdown in [LOC Norway] where another 3 suspects were arrested on similar grounds .

A 081121 report by the [ORG International Campaign to Ban Landmines] said [LOC Greece] , [LOC Turkey] and [LOC Belarus] have missed deadlines that were required under an international treaty to destroy their land mine stockpiles . 
Diplomats from [LOC Greece] , [LOC Turkey] and [LOC Belarus] declined to be interviewed about the report in [LOC Geneva] . 
The report quoted the Governments of [LOC Greece] , [LOC Turkey] and [LOC Belarus] as acknowledging that the deadlines have been missed . 
[LOC Greece] , [LOC Turkey] and [LOC Belarus] should have destroyed a total of nearly 7.5 million land mines by 080300 . 
The 1155-page annual report by the [ORG International Campaign to Ban Landmines] said [LOC Greece] mentioned legal problems with contracting a company to carry out the destruction and the difficulty of finding environmentally safe destruction sites as reasons for the delay . 
[LOC Turkey] 's government claimed preparations for getting rid of [MISC Turkish] stockpiles took longer than planned . 
[LOC Belarus] said there were delays in receiving support funds from the [ORG European Union] . 
[LOC Belarus] said remaining stockpiles contains a type of mine that is more difficult and costly to destroy .

[MISC Taiwanese] Vice President [PER Annette Lu] warned on 040212 that the transfer of [MISC European] technology to the [LOC People 's] [LOC Republic of China] could encourage the [LOC PRC] government to invade [LOC Taiwan] . 
[PER Lu] noted that the [ORG European Union] adopted a resolution to ban arms sales to mainland [LOC China] after the [LOC Tiananmen massacre of 890000] and said it is worrisome that the leaders of [LOC France] and [LOC Germany] are reportedly seeking to lift the ban following years of commercial interest enticements by the [LOC PRC] government . 
[PER Lu] expressed concern that [MISC European] advanced technology will be transferred to the mainland and added that such transfers would be helpful for the [LOC PRC] government 's military buildup and will therefore encourage an invasion of [LOC Taiwan] by the mainland . 
[PER Lu] said that the government of mainland [LOC China] has tried to isolate [LOC Taiwan] diplomatically and has been increasing its military buildup against [LOC Taiwan] . 
[PER Lu] said the [LOC PRC] government has deployed around 500 missiles targeting [LOC Taiwan] and the number of missiles deployed is expected to increase to 650 next year . 
[PER Lu] described the [LOC PRC] government as a real international terrorist because of the threat of missiles aimed at [LOC Taiwan] and the [LOC PRC] 's preparations to invade [LOC Taiwan] . 
[PER Lu] added that this is why [MISC Taiwanese] President [PER Chen Shui-bian] called for a peace referendum for 040320 alongside the [MISC Taiwanese] presidential election . 
[PER Lu] said [MISC European] nations should not join the [LOC PRC] government in opposing [LOC Taiwan] 's planned referendum . 
[PER Lu] said that [LOC Taiwan] is not a part of the [ORG People 's] [LOC Republic of China] and has maintained substantive relations with almost all countries around the world even though most of them do not have diplomatic relations with [LOC Taiwan] .

[LOC Taiwan] Executive Yuan may not approve [MISC Taiwanese] participation in the construction of submarines sold from the [LOC United States] . 
A delegation of [MISC Taiwanese] legislators completed an 11-day fact-finding trip to the [LOC United States] . 
The [LOC Taiwan] Executive Yuan submitted a [LOC NT] $610.8 billion ( [LOC US] $18.23 billion ) special budget to buy 388 Patriot PAC-III missiles , 8 conventional submarines and 12 P-3 C anti-submarine aircraft from the [LOC United States] earlier this month . 
The budget is now pending approval by the [ORG Legislative Yuan] . 
[PER Ker Chien-ming] , the [ORG Democratic Progressive Party] ( [ORG DPP] ) whip at the [LOC Taiwan] legislature said on 040628 that discussions are turning negative in regard to whether the [LOC China] Shipbuilding Corp . ( [ORG CSBC] ) should take part in the construction of submarines which the [LOC United States] has promised to sell to [LOC Taiwan] . 
Navy Commander-in-Chief [PER Miao Yung-Ching] called on the [ORG Legislative Yuan] to communicate on the review of the arms procurement budget of which the submarine deal is a part . 
[PER Miao] said it is not feasible for [ORG CSBC] to take part in the construction of the submarines and that the [ORG Navy] will negotiate with the [LOC United States] on obtaining repair capacity and technology transfers . 
[LOC Miao] said that no countries want to buy conventional submarines . 
This would make it futile to give the [ORG CSBC] the capacity to build them . 
The [LOC United States] has control of the key technology in building the submarines . 
[PER Lee Wen-chung] is another [ORG DPP] legislator who has been involved . 
[PER Lee] said on 040628 that the delegation asked the [LOC United States] to shorten the delivery period of the submarines from 15 years to 10 years . 
This indicates that [LOC Taiwan] has already given up the policy of building the submarines itself . 
[PER Lee] said that if the submarines are not built by [LOC Taiwan] then the cost of the eight subs will be [LOC NT] $100 billion less than the original plan of [LOC NT] $400 billion . 
[PER Lee] 's figures were based on the price tags of submarines sold from [LOC Germany] and [LOC Spain] along with the cost of obtaining repair capacity . 
[PER Lee] was asked if the long delivery period of 10 years might affect [LOC Taiwan] 's military strength and tip the military cross-Taiwan Strait balance toward mainland [LOC China] after 050000 . 
[PER Lee] answered that any possible naval military balance tilting toward the [LOC PRC] after 050000 would not mean an eruption of war at that time . 
[PER Lee] claimed that [LOC Taiwan] still enjoys the edge in the air . 
[PER Lee] added that an order of Kidd-class destroyers due to arrive at [LOC Taiwan] by the end of next year would allow [LOC Taiwan] to still maintain its edge . 
[PER Lee] also said that the [LOC United States] will deliver the first 5 of 12 P-3 C aircraft in 080000 , with another 3 in 090000 , 4 in 100000 and the final 4 in 110000 .

The proposals have a total investment amount of 86.7 million [LOC US] dollars ( 2.64 billion [LOC NT] dollars ) . 
The moea determined in a meeting on 8 April 2008 that the investment proposals met the clauses in the [LOC China] Investment procedure issued by the ministry 's [ORG Investment Commission] . 
[ORG The Investment Commission] 's Executive Secretary [PER Fan Liang-Tung] stated the investment procedure aims to ensure [LOC Taiwan] 's investments in [LOC China] will not harm [LOC Taiwan] 's industries and economy such as by leaking key technologies to the mainland . 
Under the procedure investment plans require approval from the moea if the plans involve a single investment that exceeds 100 million [LOC US] dollars , the company 's total investment in [LOC China] reaches 200 million [LOC US] dollars , or the investment could transfer core local industries' technologies to [LOC China] . 
Fan stated core industries mainly involve the manufacturing of 8-inch wafers and 4-inch TFT panels as well as [ORG IC] packaging . 
After the meeting on 8 April 2008 the [ORG Commission] requires written documents to further assess the plans which contain each company 's commitment on the terms of investment including the financial plan , information on any technology transfers and the company 's domestic investment as well as employment information .

The long process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled [LOC Balkans] was formally launched on 951218 in [LOC Bonn] , [LOC Germany] . 
Foreign ministers , ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met in [LOC Bonn] to discuss what form further talks should take . 
There are huge obstacles to achieving peace and cooperation among combatants in the former [LOC Yugoslavia] . 
[MISC German] Foreign Minister [PER Klaus Kinkel] said in opening remarks at the one-day meeting that there can be no peace in the former [LOC Yugoslavia] if some parties to the conflict remain heavily armed and others try to catch up . 
The [MISC Croation] delegation threatened to pull out of arms-reduction negotiations if certain demands were not met in the nearest future . 
Delegates from other countries called on [LOC Croatia] , [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina] and [LOC Serbia] to set aside their grievances and learn to compromise . 
[MISC Croatian] Foreign Minister [PER Mate Granic] complained that a part of [MISC Croatian] territory is under occupation and time is running out . 
[PER Granic] said in reference to disputed lands on the [MISC Croatian] - [MISC Serbian] border that the peaceful re-integration of [LOC Eastern] Slavonia is the key to the lasting stability in the region and that everyone faces the danger of another round of hostilities and the destabilization of the whole region and highly unpredictable consequences for [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina] without it . 
Conference participants said Foreign Minister [PER Milan Milutinovic] from [LOC Serbia] scolded his [MISC Croatian] counterpart for grandstanding . 
Then [MISC Milutinovic] made a threat to pull out of arms-control negotiations . 
Milutinovic noted the [MISC Serbian] Government has been suspended since 920000 from the [ORG Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe] and said that unless full membership were restored [LOC Yugoslavia] will be prevented from cooperating despite its readiness to do so . 
The [ORG OSCE] is to oversee the next round of [LOC Balkan] arms-reduction talks . 
[PER Michael Williams] is a senior fellow at the [ORG International Institute for Strategic Studies] in [LOC London] and formerly the [ORG United Nations'] senior spokesman for [LOC Croatia] and called the early threats from [LOC Croatia] and [LOC Serbia] a worrying development and an ominous development . 
[ORG Williams] said it was really not clear that the parties are willing to engage in any arms control in a meaningful way . 
This corresponds to a fear expressed by some delegates to the 951218 [LOC Bonn] meeting that the yugolav parties do not want to negotiate away the ability to use violence or a threat of violence to seize territory . 
[MISC Greek] Foreign Minister [PER karelos Papoulias] observed of the [LOC Balkan] belligerents that during talk in the plenary session one realizes that this is still the way they are thinking . 
[PER Papoulias] said the [MISC Greek] government is not as optimistic as other [MISC European] partners and that just because there is a Conference doesn't mean there is friendship between the people of the former [LOC Yugoslavia] . 
The 951218 talks were organized to fulfill the combatants' pledge made in [LOC Dayton] , [LOC Ohio] , to begin talks to enhance mutual confidence and reduce the risk of conflict within 7 days of the [ORG Peace Accord] 's formal signing . 
The agenda on 951218 was limited to set the formal process for coming weeks . 
The [MISC German] [ORG Foreign Ministry] said in a statement that this was so as to clear the way for speedy negotiation of the substantive questions . 
[LOC Croatia] , [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina] and [LOC Serbia] are the nations that signed the [LOC Dayton] accord and are supposed to report how many tanks and armored vehicles , heavy artillery pieces , combat aircraft and attack helicopters they possess in the next phase . 
This data will be used to establish baselines from which weapons ceilings can be agreed on . 
[LOC Croatia] , [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina] and [LOC Serbia] have promised to accept a set of automatic limits if agreement on such ceilings cannot be reached in 180 days . 
[PER Kinkel] said that on 951218 delegates had been unable to fix a date for the next round of talks but said the next talks would be 960104 or 960107 in [LOC Vienna] . 
[PER Kinkel] said minor problems not substantive discord kept delegates from choosing a firm date .

The kuwolsan departed [LOC North Korea] 's [LOC Nampo] harbor on 10 April 1999 . 
Records show that on 20 April 1999 the kuwolsan made detours to 2 [MISC Thai] ports to pick up 14000 tons of sugar for resale along the way to the kuwolsan 's destination . 
The kuwolsan switched course in order to sell the sugar to an [MISC Indian] company after a deal to sell the sugar to [MISC Algerians] failed . 
An [MISC Indian] investigator stated that the crew of the kuwolsan should not have picked up extra cargo at several ports when carrying 200 tons of sensitive equipment and that such activity was crazy . 
[MISC Indian] customs officials were tipped off to possible contraband on the kuwolsan while the kuwolsan was en route to [LOC Kandla] . 
The kuwolsan was rumored to be carrying arms or ammunition possibly intended for [LOC Pakistan] . 
[MISC Indian] port officials were waiting when the kuwolsan arrived in [LOC Kandla] on 25 June 1999 . 
Irregularities in the kuwolsan 's papers were apparent within the first few hours of investigation . 
[MISC Indian] officials learned that the company in [LOC Malta] listed as the intended recipient of the cargo was fictitious . 
[MISC Indian] officials questioned why anyone in [LOC Malta] would choose to buy water refining equipment from [LOC North Korea] when [LOC Malta] is a short flight from [LOC Europe] . 
[MISC Indian] customs agents questioned the captain of the kuwolsan [PER Tae Min Hun] . 
[PER Tae] blocked every request and threatened international reprisals if [MISC Indian] officials did not allow [PER Tae] to leave [LOC Kandla] . 
On 30 June 1999 customs officials demanded to search the kuwolsan 's cargo boxes and [PER Tae] stated that the kuwolsan had received a telex from [MISC North Korean] officials . 
Tae received instructions from officials in [LOC Pyongyang] to allow no one to open the cargo boxes at all costs . 
The official [MISC Indian] after-action report stated [PER Tae] would not open any more boxes as per the telex . 
The report stated the crew members shouted at and abused the customs officers . 
According to witness accounts and video footage of the encounter , tae and the crew of the kuwolsan barricaded the doors of the kuwolsan with the crews' bodies . 
An [MISC Indian] official who was present on the kuwolsan and who spoke on the condition of anonymity stated the situation became physical and there were fisticuffs . 
The official stated the crew began closing the hatches to the cargo hold with the customs inspectors still inside . 
On 1 July 1999 armed troops and a group of government weapons experts aided customs officials and gained forcible entry onto the kuwolsan . 
A few crates among the kuwolsan 's cargo contained equipment that could be used in a water treatment plant . 
Inspectors found pumps , nozzles and a few valves . 
The cargo boxes were labeled as water refinement equipment . 
Documents from the investigation contain a partial list of the contents of most of the cargo crates which included -- 
Components for missile subassembly . 
[ORG Machine Tools] for setting up a fabrication facility . 
Instrumentation for evaluating the performance of a full missile system . 
Equipment for calibrating missile components . 
Rocket nose cones , stacks of metal pipe and heavy-duty presses used for milling high-grade steel . 
A Plate-bending machine capable of rolling thick metal sheets , toroidal air bottles used to guide warheads after separation from a missile , and [PER Theodolites] that measure missile trajectories . 
Several boxes of engineering drawings , blueprints , notebooks , textbooks and reports . 
Personal items presumably intended for [MISC North Korean] workers , including cookbooks in [MISC Korean] , [MISC Korean] spices , pickles and acupuncture sets . 
An [MISC Indian] government official familiar with the kuwolsan discovery stated that in the past officials had seen missiles or engine parts , but here was an entire assembly line for missiles offered for sale . 
The official stated that this was a complete technology transfer . 
A technical committee of [MISC Indian] missile experts stated that the equipment was unimpeachable and irrefutable evidence of a plan to transfer not just missiles but missile-making capability . 
The technical panel wrote in a report that the cargo points to only one end-use , namely the assembling of missiles and manufacture of the parts and subassemblies of surface to surface missiles . 
Investigators searched the blueprints that were kept inside numbered plastic jackets and wrapped in brown paper . 
Some of the packets were labeled in [MISC English] as Scud B or Scud [PER C. Nearly] all of the drawings showed rockets or sections of rockets with notes and mathematical formulas handwritten in [MISC Korean] . 
[MISC Native Korean] speakers assisted in translation but the documents contained technical code invented by [MISC North Korean] scientists to replace scientific terms in [MISC Russian] or [MISC Chinese] . 
The investigation ultimately yielded information about [LOC North Korea] 's weapons program which [MISC Indian] authorities shared with ally Governments . 
The Scud B and Scud C designs found on the kuwolsan were from older [MISC North Korean] missile programs which were derived from [LOC Soviet] missile designs of the 1950s . 
One [MISC Indian] government official who studied the blueprints stated the science was old and dated but still functional . 
Retired director of the [ORG State Department 's Office] on strategic , proliferation and military issues in the [ORG Bureau of Intelligence and Research] [PER Greg Thielmann] stated the [ORG CIA] utilized the blueprints to make full mock-ups of missiles complete with decals . 
The blueprints included information pertaining to the inner workings of [LOC North Korea] 's missile industry which has been the focus of contention between the [LOC United States] and [LOC North Korea] since the 1980s . 
The cargo on the kuwolsan did not include everything needed for missile production which raises the possibility that there may have been earlier and possible later shipments . 
Missile expert and senior analyst at the [ORG Center for Nonproliferation Studies] [PER Timothy V. McCarthy] examined some of the blueprints and other evidence and stated this was a slice in time of a technology transfer from [LOC North Korea] to [LOC Libya] . 
[PER McCarthy] stated the intelligence find helps [LOC U.S.] officials learn how [MISC North Korean] missile scientists learn . 
[PER McCarthy] stated the information gives [LOC U.S.] officials an idea of how capable [MISC North Korean] scientists are of progressing to more advanced missiles and gives [LOC U.S.] officials insight into the aspect of proliferation when one country 's officials attempt to transfer technology to another country 's officials . 
[PER McCarthy] stated no one can stop [MISC Libyan] scientists once the scientists are capable of making missiles . 
The kuwolsan and the crew were unaccounted for after [MISC Indian] officials released the kuwolsan in 2000 . 
Shipping experts at [LOC Lloyd 's] maritime division in [LOC London] stated the kuwolsan 's name was changed in the summer of 2000 to [ORG Sun] grisan 9 . 
As of the week of 3 August 2003 the sun grisan 9 was still in service and was last reported headed to the [MISC Somalian] capital of [LOC Mogadishu] . 
The nature of the [ORG Sun grisan] 9 's cargo was unknown . 
As of 14 August 2003 the evidence from the kuwolsan is secured in a military warehouse in [LOC New Delhi] . 
As stated in court documents and interviews with officials in the [LOC United States] and [LOC India] the kuwolsan incident has reinforced a view of [LOC North Korea] as the world 's most dangerous source of weapons proliferation . 
In 1999 [MISC North Korean] leader [PER Kim Jong Il] expelled [ORG U.N.] inspectors , abandoned the [MISC Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] and declared plans to build an atomic weapon . 
[LOC U.S.] intelligence officials stated that [MISC North Korean] officials are continuing global trade in technology for weapons of mass destruction including instructions for making advanced missiles . 
Successive [LOC U.S.] administrations have condemned [LOC North Korea] 's missile sales to such countries as [LOC Iran] and [LOC Syria] . 
On 31 August 1998 [MISC North Korean] officials launched a 3-stage missile which heightened fears of advanced [MISC North Korean] designs capable of reaching the [LOC U.S.] mainland . 
The first stage splashed down in the [LOC Sea] of [LOC Japan] , the second stage crossed the main island of [LOC Japan] and the third broke up and traveled 3450 miles downrange and fell into the [LOC Pacific Ocean] . 
The missile test fueled work on a [LOC U.S.] missile defense shield . 
[MISC North Korean] officials have defended the right to sell weapons and have stated that [MISC North Korean] officials are not bound by international treaties restricting such trade . 
[MISC North Korean] officials have sold missiles and parts to [LOC Yemen] which received 15 Scud missiles after the missiles were briefly intercepted by [LOC U.S.] and [MISC Spanish] naval crews off the [MISC Yemeni] coast in December 1998 . 
[LOC Libya] appears to be the latest beneficiary of [MISC North Korean] weapons . 
Other nations including [LOC Iran] , [LOC Pakistan] and [LOC Syria] are known to have received similar help . 
The kuwolsan cargo attests to the existence of a gray zone composed of a combination of weak States , open borders , lack of controls and a market of buyers and sellers of weapons of mass destruction . 
Small packages are sometimes delivered in the luggage of individual airline passengers such as a [MISC Taiwanese] businessman arrested at [LOC Zurich] 's airport in 2000 with [MISC North Korean] missile parts in a rucksack . 
Larger items are moved in freighters such as the kuwolsan while technical information and designs are accessible via the [MISC Internet] . 
[LOC Korea] specialist with the [ORG Center for Nonproliferation Studies] at the [ORG Monterey Institute of International Studies] in [LOC California] [PER Daniel pinkston] stated that intercepting weapons and equipment is difficult but not impossible but that human exchanges of plans , data , and intellectual property are difficult to intercept .

[LOC China] confirmed on January 23 , 2007 after 12 days of silence that [LOC China] had fired a guided missile into space to destroy one of its satellites . 
The test caused protests from the [LOC United States] and other nations . 
[ORG Foreign Ministry] spokesman [PER Liu Jianchao] said the [LOC United States] and other Governments have now been informed about the secret test through diplomatic channels . 
[PER Liu Jianchao] stated that the use of anti-satellite technology does not mean [LOC China] has abandoned its long-standing opposition to the military use of space . 
[PER Liu Jianchao] said at a ministry briefing that the test was not targeted against any country and does not pose a threat to any country . 
[PER Liu Jianchao] said that no plans for another such test by the secretive [MISC Chinese] military . 
The [MISC Chinese] test shot destroyed an overage weather satellite 537 miles above [LOC Earth] and was detected by [LOC U.S.] monitors January 11 , 2007 . 
The [MISC Chinese] government refused to discuss it . 
The test raised concern in the [LOC United States] . 
Officials and analysts interpreted it as a signal that [LOC U.S.] military satellites could be vulnerable to attack by [LOC China] . 
[LOC China] 's ability to shoot down satellites could pose an added threat in the event of hostilities over [LOC Taiwan] because the [LOC U.S.] military relies on satellites for reconnaissance , navigation , weapons guidance systems and anti-missile defenses . 
[LOC China] 's newly demonstrated ability could threaten [MISC Taiwanese] satellites monitoring [MISC Chinese] short- and medium-range missile deployments along the [LOC Taiwan] Strait . 
[LOC U.S.] officials were dismayed by the [MISC Chinese] test because the [LOC United States] and [LOC Russia] have abstained from such tests after testing anti-satellite technology in the 1980s . 
This decision was partly because destroying satellites creates debris that could damage satellites in nearby orbits . 
[PER Liu] declined to address questions on this danger . 
Experts estimate that several hundred thousand debris fragments were created by the destruction of the satellite . 
The satellite orbited in a section of space where 125 other satellites fly . 
[LOC China] has started an accelerated military modernization program and has repeatedly stated its desire to be able to compete in 21st-century warfare . 
This includes the use of advanced electronics and information systems . 
The [MISC Chinese] military runs [LOC China] 's space program and has identified space-based communications and sensing systems as key to such efforts . 
Some [MISC Chinese] military theorists have advocated asymmetrical warfare . 
Pinpoint weapons would be used to disrupt the more advanced and better-equipped [LOC U.S.] military . 
Analysts believed that the January 11 , 2007 test was part of the military modernization program despite [LOC China] 's frequent declarations that it wants to prevent an arms race in space . 
[PER Liu] repeated the long-standing [MISC Chinese] position when asked about the appearance of a contradiction and said [LOC China] will further promote de-weaponization and the peaceful use of outer space . 
[LOC China] has consistently advocated at the [ORG United Nations] for the peaceful development of space and pushed for an international agreement to prevent it from becoming the theater for a new arms race . 
The [LOC United States] has opposed [LOC China] 's suggestion for an international conference to pursue such an accord and argued there is no need for it . 
[PER Liu] was asked whether the anti-satellite test violated the spirit of [LOC China] 's proclaimed position and why [LOC China] kept silent for nearly two weeks while officials around the world were discussing it on the basis of [LOC U.S.] intelligence reports . 
[PER Liu] said [LOC China] has nothing to hide . 
[LOC China] made the response about the test quickly after the relevant parties expressed their concerns . 
[LOC China] stressed that opposition of weaponization and an arms race in outer space . 
[LOC China] 's position has not changed .

The men were mostly of them lawyers and professors . 
Al-Faleh was jailed in 2004 for calling for more democracy in the kingdom . 
The men had planned to present authorities with a list of more than 40 prisoners without legal representation whom they intended to defend .

That is generally a reference to [LOC Iraq] . 
The spokesman said sizable amounts of cash had been found during searches of the men 's homes . 
Many young [MISC Saudi] radicals have crossed the long and porous border between the [LOC Kingdom] and [LOC Iraq] and joined up with [MISC Sunni Muslim] insurgents there . 
[PER Alim] said that the government 's accusations were baseless and that his clients were well-known reformists with no connection to terrorism . 
[PER Alim] said the men might have been raising funds for [MISC Palestinian] or [MISC Iraqi] refugees . 
The men had been warned repeatedly by the government not to gather or write petitions because authorities feared the rise of a new political reform movement . 
[PER Alim] said the men do not want any kind of organized reform movement . 
The men are trying to stop any organized calls for reform .

[LOC China] has built and launched a communications satellite for [LOC Nigeria] . 
The satellite demonstrate 's [LOC China] 's increasing skill in space technology . 
[MISC Chinese] officials stated on May 14 , 2007 that [LOC China] had launched a [MISC Chinese] manufactured communications satellite into orbit on behalf of [LOC Nigeria] . 
[MISC Chinese] officials stated that the geostationary satellite will provide communications services over [LOC Africa] and parts of the [LOC Middle East] and [LOC Southern Europe] . 
The [MISC Chinese] officials also stated that the satellite will go into operation by the end of 2007 and is expected to last 15 years . 
The satellite will be managed from a control station in [LOC Abuja] , [LOC Nigeria] . 
This launch marks the first time [LOC China] has built a commercial satellite and put the satellite into orbit on contract for another country . 
The launch occurred on May 14 , 2007 before dawn near the [LOC Xichang] space center in southwestern [LOC Sichuan] province . 
Some view the launch as another sign of [LOC China] 's increasing skill in space technology and [LOC China] 's determination to be among the world 's great powers seeking to utilize the reaches of outer space for benefits on earth . 
[LOC China] 's space program 's rapid progress has caused worries in the [LOC United States] because the program is run by the military and [LOC China] has been recently emphasizing space-based information warfare . 
The concern intensified following the successful January 11 , 2007 test-firing of an anti-satellite missile . 
Some analysts stated that the test-firing demonstrated a risk to the many satellites on which [LOC United States] military forces rely for navigation and weapons guidance . 
[LOC China] 's space agency sent 2 astronauts into orbit in October 2005 in the [ORG Agency] 's second manned spaceflight . 
The [MISC Chinese] government on May 7 , 2007 adopted a 10 year plan for expanded space exploration . 
The plan includes more manned flights as well as unmanned probes of the [LOC Moon] and beyond . 
[MISC Chinese] officials stated that the launch of the nigcomsat-1 aboard a [MISC Long] March 3 B rocket on May 14 , 2007 represented a commercial challenge . 
Some saw the launch as a symbol of [LOC China] 's broad network of economic relations with [LOC Africa] .

[LOC Nigeria] 's managing director of the nigcomsat-1 project [PER Hammed Rufai] stated that the launch was a breakthrough in ending the exclusive reliance on oil because the satellite will help [LOC Nigeria] move toward knowledge-based industries . 
The official [ORG New China News Agency] stated that [LOC China] secured the 311 million dollar contract in 2004 in a bidding process in which 21 other companies took part . 
President of the [ORG Great Wall Industry Corporation] [PER Wang Haibo] stated that the [MISC Nigerian] contract puts [LOC China] onto the short list of countries that can build , launch and maintain a satellite for other nations . 
[MISC Chinese] officials stated that about 30 similar contracts have been signed for future launches . 
In the 1990s [LOC China] frequently launched satellites for other countries after the satellites were manufactured elsewhere and acquired a reputation for providing such services more cheaply than other launch-capable countries . 
[LOC China] had been trying to establish commercial relations with oil-producing nations such as [LOC Nigeria] as the [MISC Chinese] economy grows nearly 10 percent a year .

At least 46 people were killed by the end of the week . 
There were multiple attacks including hand-grenade assaults and decapitations , with police , federal agents and rival drug-traffickers the principal victims . 
[LOC Mexico] 's drug-trafficking wars continued during the funeral of a 10-year-old boy . 
The boy died in a drowning accident unrelated to drug trafficking . 
The boy 's grandfather was [PER Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo] . 
[PER Gallardo] is the fugitive Founder of the [LOC Tijuana] drug cartel . 
June 4 , 2007 6 hooded gunmen entered the traditional all-night wake and shot two people , killing both . 
One newspaper called the gunmen commandos . 
The gunmen had written Z 's on the victims' backs before the left . 
The Z is a symbol of the [LOC Gulf] cartel . 
At least 46 more people were killed by the end of the week . 
There were multiple attacks including hand-grenade assaults and decapitations , with police , federal agents and rival drug-traffickers the principal victims . 
The killings show the scope of the violence and the tactics of psychological warfare behind it . 
The killings are dispersed across the country . 
Many deaths appear to involve disputes between competing bands of traffickers . 
At least one of those bands appears to be splitting into different groups . 
Authorities in [LOC Tuxtepec] on June 5 , 2007 found a severed head with a note . 
The note stated that this is going to happen to all the people who work with the zetas . 
It referred to the hit men who work for the [LOC Gulf] cartel . 
The message was signed as the new blood . 
[LOC Tuxtepec] is in the southeast side of [LOC Oaxaca] . 
The new blood refers to a group of [LOC Gulf] cartel operatives who have turned against the zetas as members of the organization bid to control trafficking routes and local drug markets . 
[LOC Mexico] 's Secretary of Public Safety [PER Genaro Garcia Luna] said in May 2007 that the [LOC Gulf] cartel had split into rival bands . 
[PER Garcia Luna] said in a recent press conference that the extreme violence in [LOC Mexico] was part of a strategy by drug traffickers to force authorities into a strategic retreat . 
[PER Garcia Luna] said that they are trying to create a climate of intimidation and fear in order to gain operational advantages . 
[PER Luna] said the residents of a rural town or urban neighborhood will refuse to cooperate with authorities and create a social space of support for traffickers if they believe that drug traffickers cannot be defeated .

The websites of [LOC Mexico City] newspapers on June 8 , 2007 reported as many as 20 people had been gunned down nationwide in drug-related violence the previous 24 hours . 
The dead included three people shot on a highway in the [ORG State of Durango] in northwest [LOC Mexico] . 
This happened on a week when President [PER Felipe Calderon] traveled to [LOC Europe] to meet with [PER Pope Benedict XVI] and other leaders . 
[PER Calderon] told reporters on June 4 , 2007 in [LOC Rome] that consumers in the [LOC United States] were to blame for the drug-driven chaos in [LOC Mexico] . 
[PER Calderon] said that this is a shared problem between the [LOC United States] and [LOC Mexico] . 
The principal cause is the use of drugs . 
And the [LOC U.S.] is the prime consumer in the world .

When meeting with the Governor of [LOC Macao] [PER Viera] here today , Premier of the [ORG State Council Peng Li] said the policy of the [MISC Chinese] government towards [LOC Macao] is consistent , firm and unchanging , and that the [MISC Chinese] government would , in accordance to the policy of " one country , two systems " and strictly according to the regulations in the joint declaration between [LOC China] and [LOC Portugal] and the Basic Laws of [LOC Macao] , maintain the stability and development of [LOC Macao] . 
[PER Peng Li] expressed welcome at the periodic visit of [PER Viera] . 
He said : " In recent years , the friendly co-operative relationships between the two countries namely [LOC China] and [LOC Portugal] in various arenas have been developing continuously , mutual visits by top level leaders of both countries have also increased . 
President [PER Zemin Jiang] , Vice President [PER Yiren Rong] and myself have all visited [LOC Portugal] , and Prime Minister [PER Shewar] visited [LOC China] in April of this year . " 
He said , the smooth development of the bilateral relationship between [LOC China] and [LOC Portugal] established the foundation for co-operation on the [LOC Macao] issue . 
[PER Peng Li] pointed out , the [LOC Macao] issue was an important component of the relationship between [LOC China] and [LOC Portugal] . 
Maintaining good relationships between the two countries of [LOC China] and [LOC Portugal] , as well as the inland and [LOC Macao] , is beneficial for the social stability and economic development . 
[PER Peng Li] said since the joint declaration between [LOC China] and [LOC Portugal] came into effect , both sides had done quite a lot of work in the thorough implementation of the joint declaration , and that co-operation has been effective . 
In recent years , under the joint effort of both sides , many issues of mutual concern to both sides had been resolved , various degrees of progress have been achieved in the three major issues , namely languages , civil servants , and laws in the transition period of [LOC Macao] . 
He said : " We hope that the [LOC Macao] government will continue to give their attention to these three problems , in order to achieve final proper resolution . " 
[PER Peng Li] said , " Governor [PER Viera] has done a lot of beneficial work in the smooth resolution of the [LOC Macao] issue , for this we express our appreciation . " 
[PER Peng Li] also emphasized , with the approach of 1999 , that there is still a lot of work to be done by both the [MISC Chinese] and [MISC Portuguese] sides on the [LOC Macao] issue , and that the mission is very important . 
Both sides should resolve the outstanding issues in the spirit of friendly consultations .
