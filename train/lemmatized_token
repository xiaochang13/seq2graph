establish model in industrial innovation
after its competitor invent the front load wash machine , the ceo of the american im company believe that each of its employee have the ability for innovation , and formulate strategic countermeasure for innovation in the industry .
1. establish an innovation fund with a maximum amount of 1,000 u.s. dollar .
2. choose 100 innovative concept to encourage employee to conduct research and development during their work time or spare time .
3. from among them , pick out 50 for submission to an assessment committee to assess .
since the tangshan earthquake , the start point for construction standard in the mainland be that under an earthquake of the same magnitude , building should preserve their basic frame without collapse .
however , most of the building in this hard @-@ hit area do not meet these requirement , with the widespread collapse of school building in particular arouse intense public disgust .
raise standard to in excess of tangshan 's 8.0 magnitude could leave authority with some breathe space for explanation , and alleviate public anger .
accord to information leak from numerous channel , we can say for certain that before the earthquake struck , the serious earthquake risk in the ngawa region be already well know to the ccp .
although current forecast standard cannot give us an accurate prediction of the exact time , place , and strength of an earthquake , there be considerable experience accumulate both in china and overseas in predict to within the timeframe of a month , and the area of a province .
in region where the earthquake risk be high , warn the public and spread disaster prevention awareness could greatly reduce casualty during earthquake ; this be the very minimum duty that any responsible government should undertake .
in the past the ccp have do a lot of these sort of thing , but on this occasion not only do nothing , but in response to query from the public pull out some whop lie , play syntax game with word like " geological disaster " and " earthquake disaster ".
i think that if our earthquake administration have be able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquake on this longmenshan mountain earthquake belt , then on that day of may 12 , once the earthquake administration have measure the quake at a magnitude of 7.8 , we would have be able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the earthquake disaster zone .
if the simulation program be well design , circumstance like debris block road , heavy rainfall obstruct parachute drop , power and communication outage should all have be within expectation .
instead in this instance the liberation army headquarters emergency contingency plan obviously be not a contingency plan design with earthquake as the assume condition , as the soldier all rush straight to wenchuan , without immediately send out troop in the direction of badly @-@ hit area beichuan , qingchuan and gansu 's longnan ; only 24 hour later be the full extent of the disaster area take into consideration .
in addition , the breakdown in communication also bring a serious problem to the surface . in the past , red army regiment be able to maintain contact with central headquarters by relying on just one batter radio . on this occasion though , people have no way to deal with the communication failure .
it be clear that preparation prior to the event be not construct on the basis of an earthquake disaster simulation .
while it should have be a disaster relief command that take overall leadership , it have suddenly come face @-@ to @-@ face with the broad base of disaster victim , directly deal with them .
the lack or serious shortage of intermediate layer of party organization and unit between the two have result in its inability to consider major issue with endless minor issue on hand , such that even if it be highly capable , it won't last long , as it will be drag down by numerous petty thing .
this would have be unimaginable during the great tangshan earthquake . a time without volunteer or mental worker , such petty thing as directly deal with average people be perform by the most primary party branch , as well as enterprise and public institution .
as soon as the earthquake occur , grass @-@ root organization contact their own people and average people also contact their own system or department , in an interdependent manner .
under the centralized leadership of higher @-@ level organization , everyone act to make the rescue effort very outstanding and successful , such that the great tangshan earthquake , which happen just a few year ago , be forget all together in the subsequent reform and open @-@ up .
it be obvious that no social or political problem be leave then , nor be sequelae that cause headache to later generation .
during a time of prosperity and happiness , such a big earthquake suddenly struck .
many people die , much property be destroy , it be quite clearly a great disaster .
but it be not totally without benefit , and i believe that its greatest benefit be that it serve to strip off the false benevolence that compose the outer skin of the elitist , the politician , the capitalist , and expose once and for all the rotten cannibalistic core within .
and an additional benefit be that many people who have be delude came to their sense .
temporarily lay aside these abstract thing and avoid speak at length , say only a few detail that leave the elitist , the politician and capitalist highly embarrass .
the expert have just finish say " sacrifice yourself to help others be a foolish idea ", when the leader have no choice but to call once again for selfless devotion .
this be mere chicanery , to the point where before engaging in life @-@ save , donation to charity , these sort of behaviors , an idea have to be flash through people 's mind :
am i be foolish in do this ?
and when people see on cctv those private firm manufacture tent in jiangsu and zhejiang work overtime to produce more tent , the first idea that popped to mind i 'm afraid was probably " this time these capitalist have struck it big ! "
" why be it that these capitalist instead of those capitalist get the big order form , surely there could n't be anything fishy involve ?
during this process , there be again talk about file a complaint against the xinghui travel agency .
the reason for file the complaint be that even if we owe their hourly fee , they still should fulfill their obligation on the contract they sign : drive people from canberra back to sydney .
as long as we stick to this issue , xinghui surely have no way of win the lawsuit if it go to court .
however , what greatly surprise me be the attitude of the student union in this appeal . they seem very reluctant to make the contract public .
they even lie , say that they and xinghui initially feel that sign a contract would rather make each other feel like stranger since they be both do it for the sake of the motherland .
as you know , this type of logic absolutely won't work in australia .
xinghui accept this order of ours and deploy all the bus of other travel agency in sydney .
without the guarantee from the contract sign with us , they would surely have be unable to deploy them !
in addition , there be something else that be very suspicious .
i hear from a friend at the consulate that the government take this matter very seriously and have promptly agree to allocate fund to compensate the student who have use their own money instead that night .
yesterday afternoon i go back to check out the torch relay , but even the flame be practically impossible to see , let alone the guy carry the torch .
there be so many people there it be frighten . some have even climb onto the roof of bus !
i head straight for the center of activity , but in actual fact traffic be be control as early as 4 o'clock , and they have already start limit the crowd enter the sport center .
some guy be really insane , band together in group and yell out " go china ! "
i actually have some other classmate there , and be go to call them .
i guess the carry capacity of the base station tower be totally overload , and i could n't get through at all . i be only able to find a signal , not a chance of connect to the internet .
only one phone call i make there get through - that be call home .
i have a look at my call register , and out of dozen of call dialed only one be properly connect !
sometime after 6 i go straight back home to watch it on tv . the spectacle be just as astonish on tv , except that it be just one angle of the whole thing .
next time i won't be partake in this kind of activity ! !
wang shi 's experience of be under public condemnation underscore to a certain extent the tense relationship between the rich and poor class in chinese society ;
because as china grow prosperous day by day , the gap of wealth between the successful elite and the remain 1.3 billion people be widen .
thirty year ago , people have basically the same income , which be all deplorably meager .
however , hurun report ( hurun report ) show that by 2007 , there be a total of 106 billionaires ( in u.s. dollar ) in china , with the number of people only next to that of the unite state .
now , wang shi say , these response have have effect on me .
he admit that he be not sensitive enough to the current situation when he write his blog .
wang shi note additionally that since china currently have not yet establish a sound system of social security insurance , the grow hatred of the rich be unavoidable .
on tuesday , wanke announce that it would make an additional donation of rmb 100 million yuan for the temporary resettlement and post @-@ disaster reconstruction in the next three to five year .
yao ming , the basketball player who be hail as a national hero thank to his success in establish himself in nba , be also blame after he announce his donation of rmb two million yuan because a rumor on the internet allege he have donate one million u.s. dollar for disaster relief of hurricane katrina ( hurricane ) in 2005 .
even so , donation behavior and the treatment of donation behavior should not deviate from two principle , namely that it be voluntary and do not seek return . otherwise , the donation lose its original mean .
in actual fact , whether it be mcdonalds or any other foreign own enterprise in china on the so @-@ call " international iron rooster " blacklist , they all give generously to the cause of help the disaster victim , exhibit their social responsibility .
even if by comparison some company really do n't donate a huge amount , they should not be besiege or subject to verbal violence in the arena of public opinion .
donate , after all , be not a legal obligation that company must carry out . urge business to donate apart from the force of moral consideration should not take the form of any other coercive mean .
as long as a company 's source of income be legal , any compulsory payment outside of legal obligation be a kind of theft .
even in an abnormal circumstance such as disaster relief , legal order and the right bestow upon by law should be respect .
if we be unfortunate enough to be unable to avoid become a disaster victim , we can at least preserve the nobility and dignity of humanity and not turn into rabble .
the lawsuit propose by hai ming do not have a clear subject of the right of action ; moreover it do not satisfy the legal requirement for libel .
for example , he fail to clarify whether cafferty 's comment be an argument over opinion or an act of spread an untruthful statement .
the malicious intent of cafferty have not be establish , either . more importantly , he have be unable to offer anything as to how to establish the damage to the 1.3 billion chinese people .
in addition , in his complaint , it be say that chinese people have already express their displeasure through demonstration .
here it be a country with the freedom of speech .
on the issue of libel , court only support those who have actually suffer damage and have no other way to seek justice .
therefore , it be very hard for the government , politician , and public figure to get legal protection on the issue of libel ,
because they have the capability to clear themselves of " smear ."
if you have already clear your own reputation through legal protest , for example , chinese people be not goon and thug , then a lawsuit be meaningless .
remember , a lawsuit for libel be only to clear your name and get compensation .
after lee teng @-@ hui put forth the " two state theory ", due to mainland countrymen be deceive by the ccp 's propaganda machine , many people advocate use force to unite taiwan .
because they have no understand whatsoever of the situation in taiwan and the will of the taiwan people ,
they universally exhibit extreme nationalistic sentiment .
just like the love @-@ hate fusion of nationalistic war sentiment that erupt after the us mistakenly bomb the chinese embassy .
they similarly do not understand the real story in kosovo .
but hong kong people realize that first there be the republic of china , only after that come " new china ";
while this " two state separatist theory " have purely and simply be dream up by the ccp .
lee teng @-@ hui be do nothing but bring an already exist phenomenon to light .
moreover , the grand old men of the ccp who hand over on a silver platter a huge chunk of land in manchuria north of the amur river to soviet russia , who give away land equivalent to ten percent of national territory in northern mongolia ; why not take this back , instead of insist on try to grab back a taiwan that remain in the hand of chinese people ?
however , even though hong kong people have their grumble , the " two state theory " have in no way trigger a sentimental attachment in hong kong people for " old china ".
i believe that our build industry here have not yet reach this level .
not only have the law not yet reach this level , but the average person 's understand have generally not reach this level .
some official , out of local economic consideration , by accident or design be frequently too lenient in deal with property agent .
we all saw the damage wreak by the wenchuan earthquake .
as to how much of this be a result of natural disaster , and how much be man @-@ make calamity , a verdict will be draw in the end .
apparently , quality check in the space industry be extremely rigorous , each part undergo several inspection process , every effort be make to ensure absolute safety .
but space ship accident still happen from time to time .
even such technologically advance nation as the us have experience several instance of space flight launch or return failure .
since thing can still go wrong even when they be subject to incredibly rigorous inspection as in the space industry , then , with our current " dark " and corrupt property industry the way it be , people 's life be even harder to place guarantee on .
once a powerful earthquake strike , the people 's life really do become as tiny as those of ant .
it make one tremble even without fear .
follow the great wenchuan earthquake this time , there be compatriot who struggle out of the debris , wipe their tear and bury the body of their family , but they brace up again and declare to the world , " we be not beat down ; we be on our feet again ; the earthquake cannot shake the staunch will of the chinese people ; trial and tribulation serve only to revitalize a nation ! "
this enable us to see the fight spirit of the dauntless chinese nation give off a dazzle radiance among people in disaster @-@ hit area .
the fact that these word be speak by compatriot who have be through the disaster have give us , who could n't help our tear at the sight of their mishap , so much comfort and encouragement . it give us a hint that no force can beat down the chinese people .
however , the word later reappear somewhere else and from someone unusual , which i think about for a few day . i feel , for some unknown reason , it be somewhat scary !
i just want to say , let there be no more disaster , so that china be safe and sound from now on and disaster be far away from china .
i pray to the god to open his eye and do n't let disaster visit the chinese land again !
we do n't want to revitalize the nation through trial and tribulation ,
but rather we want to revitalize the nation by pass our day safe and sound !
one important reason that a great number of people bury or trap in debris in the wenchuan earthquake @-@ hit area be save be that they be full of hope and firmly believe the pla would come to their rescue !
to settle victim , thousand of tent that stretch mile be soon set up , which contain public toilet , shop , and primary school and middle school .
ten of thousand or even million of those displace by the disaster have gradually have a home to shelter from the wind and rain !
if everything be put in the market , such that all the land be sell to syndicate or farm owner , then where should the government set up tent ?
do they expropriate the land on the spot ?
even the government cannot override the market !
support the disaster @-@ hit area have test our competence , while the government 's ability to rule also stand the trial !
at critical moment , the rule foundation --- worker and farmer , show staunch support to the government !
if everything be put in the market , such that worker and farmer would have their fate control by the market and no long count on or rely on the government by walk onto a path of the so @-@ call " find the market rather than the mayor ( government ) ," then what power would the government have ?
the post @-@ catastrophe hyperinflation as expect by foreigner have not come either !
the government have human and financial capital under control , as well as energy and resource !
for example , the value of " seize the pleasure of the moment " also have a long history .
" sing a song when thou have wine , seize the day since life be short." some people in contemporary time think we should " satisfy and die ."
some people have go so far on the road that they " don't know how to eat or play , "
and other take nude picture and flaunt them online .
for another example , the pursuit of office title and level can also be trace back to the old day .
in ancient time there be zhou li to distinguish the order of hierarchy and nobility , construct a pyramid @-@ like social organizational structure .
the son of the heaven wore different clothe than others . the color of a door and the number of caldrons use for meal be all symbol to distinguish the hierarchy and nobility of people .
the aim be to settle dispute , stop fight and stabilize the society .
however , simultaneously it have also establish a system that value life accord to office level , which to the contrary trigger contention and destabilized the society .
yet no matter how many change of dynasty there be , the value system have always be carry on .
higher or lower rank in qing dynasty be distinguish by bird and animal pattern on clothe , taiping heavenly kingdom use the size and color of a sedan chair as the symbol to distinguish between different rank , and modern people use the motor vehicle displacement as a symbol to distinguish between different position , all of which can be trace to the same origin .
i do n't care how much wang shi waste every time he climb a mountain , but i do strongly despise how he talk and the way he act during this whole thing .
after donate , he suggest that charity should not be the burden of business , and therefore stipulate that his company 's employee donation should not exceed 10 yuan .
totally absurd logic . wang shi 's reason be that make donation to charity then the burden of business could cause company to fail in market competition ;
but we can see such philanthropist as bill gate , li ka @-@ shing , jackie chan have not affect the growth of their enterprise in any way . instead , they have actually increase the competitiveness of their company .
and there be some netizens who hit back in the wang shi donation issue by admonish us for forcing donation on moral ground .
exactly ! an excellent justification !
if you say that netizens rebuke wang shi be force donation , then what kind of behavior be wang shi prevent employee from donate more than 10 yuan ?
wang shi be the economic version of a cold @-@ blood animal , and we do n't care ,
but how come wang shi , how come he want to restrict what employee do or do n't do on moral ground ?
this really be a case of one rule for some , another rule for everyone else ! !!
we see , as at may 17 , the chinese government have accept up to 6 billion in disaster @-@ relief donation domestically and internationally , of which 4.8 billion be from domestic donor .
what we can see now be merely the name and figure of each donor constantly list in what be like an honor roll .
yet unfortunately , we do n't have more detail information of the whereabouts and specific use of the donate fund .
as corruption have long be prevalent among local government and economic audit be not transparent enough , disaster @-@ relief fund be often appropriate , exhaust , expropriate and embezzle .
therefore , once such a huge amount of disaster @-@ relief fund from people the world and china be embezzle or otherwise partially transfer by local official , the result political damage and lower of the government 's image domestically and internationally will completely negate the positive image brought by the government 's disaster @-@ relief effort .
if the donation be directly put in the hand of disaster @-@ hit people , it would push local price higher , drive the already high inflation to a direction that be even harder to regulate .
it be say that our country 's earthquake forecast be at an advanced level in the world .
but the glory of the earthquake worker do not produce good luck for the depart spirit of wenchuan .
so , we again hear expert figure emphasize once again , " earthquake forecast be a global challenge that so far no one have be able to solve ."
consequently , we come to realize that the academic laurel for " the success rate of prediction of impend earthquake that have already reach almost 40 %" be just condition and capital use to apply for fund , evaluate professional title and seek remuneration , rather than a hard rationale use to reduce bloodshed and death .
we should offer earthquake worker our full understand .
face the caprice of nature , humankind be really insignificant .
furthermore , although our sense of security increase with each pass day in line with " significant advance achieve " in seismology , we cannot look to anyone to give us any promise .
because , once someone have make a promise , he would be doom thereafter to bear this bloody weight of " be unable to effectively avoid earthquake disaster ."
and by not issue any promise , he could actually avoid be censure .
because " there be no way to make prediction "!
human can manufacture tank that be much more powerful than ant , but human cannot manufacture a live ant...
however advance instrument manufacture by human be , their level of complexity cannot compare with a section of a toad 's nerve .
do not regard earthquake prediction as a " practical skill "; rather regard it as academic work in a study .
take no notice of the real result in term of prevent earthquake or minimize disaster ; rather singlemindedly pursue the scientific research level embody in " prediction success rate ."
in the course of major disaster warning , too many dispute relate to power and interest be entangle .
the direction of research into earthquake prevention and disaster minimization be just confine to research into the phenomenon of earthquake , but effort to intervene in urban construction , to formulate and supervise build standard , and perfect and improve disaster rescue mechanism and other aspect have be neglected.... .
we have also become blindly abreast of foreign country even in earthquake research : we do n't believe in live being raise as part of nature ; we just believe in the instrument we ourselves manufacture .
we do n't believe the warning send out by nature ; we just believe the warning emit by instrument in laboratory .
we do n't believe in what be see and hear with their own eye by million of ordinary people ; we just believe in the authoritative conclusion of expert and scholar .
chinese seismology be gallop down the wrong road .
real estate be only one part of the national economy but the real estate phenomenon exist in every sector of the national economy .
the swift large @-@ scale failure and bankruptcy of collective enterprise and state @-@ own enterprise be proof of this .
thing have reach the step where the national television station have to set up a stage with the country 's military singer , high @-@ class singer , as well as top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line celebrity from all walk of life sing to folk like wang shi for donation .
we should n't be too bother if folk like wang shi say something unpleasant .
a defeat general can n't claim to be brave .
in front of folk like wang shi , the state council be all defeat general .
because the miss @-@ in @-@ action army who build new china have be beat to a pulp by folk like wang shi ; even if china have no earthquake , there will be flood , as well as sars , snowstorm , big freeze etc.
china be a land of many catastrophe - this have always be true and always will be .
relying on sing for donation , entertain for one 's supper , will not solve the problem .
and time and time again ask the national television station to get out there and carry the national flag , carry on like this in the name of the country be outrageous , it 's the state council 's problem .
all the people with one mind " as the national anthem be inspire by the foresight of " always be prepare ", design for " advance , advance , advance , enter ! " instead of be design for repeat beg , plead for donation , and fund @-@ raise .
from leader to the common people , everyone need to keep that in mind .
when we go back to the 10 th century ad , we find that the 10 th century ad give birth to the first entrepreneur .
because the 10 th century ad be the very time when limited liability company be establish ; the catholic pope of the time have such a conviction during the 9 th century .
are you afraid of go to hell when you die ?
yes , you be afraid - how could you not go just because you be afraid ?
donate your property to the church , show your loyalty to god and you won't go to hell ,
so a lot of rich people donate their money to the church before they die .
by the 10 th century ad , 60 % of britain 's territory belong to the church ,
but their clergymen could n't manage it , and be unable to pass it on to the next generation . what could they do ?
so they set up the modern limited liability company .
how do they set it up ?
they hire professional manager to run these church enterprise ,
these professional manager be the administrator ,
and who be the proprietor of these company ?
the church .
so what do this confirm ?
the first step in separate the administration right from ownership ,
in no way because this be a great system , but rather that this be inevitable within the church enterprise .
when forecast earthquake , why do it happen that only a few case be successful while most case be failure ?
accord to this writer 's many year of research on precursory sign , the existence of precursory sign and earthquake prediction be two issue that be both connect and mutual differentiate .
the appearance of a precursory sign do n't mean it can accurately forecast the three element of an earthquake , because precursory sign be extremely complicate .
there be certain difference in the category , breadth , distribution range , and duration of precursory sign of different type of earthquake in different place .
in " regional nature of precursory sign of earthquake , " this writer divide earthquake into two major type accord to the overall characteristic of pre @-@ earthquake sign : strike @-@ type and slip @-@ type earthquake .
the former occur in area where internal fault block or fault line converge but not intersect , while the latter occur in active fault line .
strike @-@ type earthquake have various type of precursory sign , which be widespread , long @-@ last , and quite variable .
slip @-@ type earthquake have fewer type of precursory sign , which have a smaller distribution range , short duration period , and smaller range of change .
in chengdu , which be over 100 kms away from the epicenter , the earthquake should not have an intensity of over 7 , or 8 at the most .
there should not be any safety problem for class a building like those at the airport , hospital and school that be design to withstand a intensity of 8 .
so most building in chengdu should still be able to use after emergency assessment , and citizen may go home reassure .
if not so , an investigation should be conduct for any jerry @-@ build project .
if large sum of money have be spend to provide protection , yet it fail to work when the earthquake come ,
such that nobody dare to live at home , be able to use hospital , or accesses airport , then have the money be throw for nothing ?
probably some would say the national build criteria for earthquake resistance be enact in recent year , and older building may not comply with the requirement .
however , at the same time the government enact the earthquake resistance criteria , it require all exist building which do not satisfy the criteria to be reinforce and remove of danger in a timely fashion .
thus one cannot shirk responsibility on excuse that it be an old build .
in addition , the government also have criteria for earthquake resistance and prevention for rural building .
the earthquake in sichuan stun everyone .
elementary school building collapse , and children be bury in the rubble .
middle school building collapse , and young student be bury under the crumble wall .
kindergarten building also collapse , and little child 's frail body fall helplessly next to the crumbled wall where they close their innocent eye forever .
we could n't help cry at this sorrowful scene .
children be the flower of our motherland and future of our motherland .
these flower of life die early in a natural disaster .
natural disaster cannot be predict , but the school building should not have collapse .
why be the building behind the school building still there while the school building where children study collapse from the first floor to the fourth floor leave only crumble wall ?
children , you should n't have depart like this .
every year , all level of people 's congress be hold from local government to the central government .
deputy to the people 's congress , please make an all @-@ around inspection of school building in all area and inspect whether or not the school building in your constituency be up to local earthquake @-@ resistance standard , and then quickly make a proposal accord to the exist problem and push each level of the government to complete rectification and improvement within a limited time .
special legislation in the national people 's congress on construction of school building should be propose .
there need to be special legal procedure for the design , material , construction , completion , and inspection of the school building to ensure that top priority be give to quality and durability .
allow all children to study safely be the sacred and bounden duty of the people 's congress .
in june 1976 , 83 year @-@ old mao zedong have already be revive once after suffer a myocardial infarction .
to get effective care for his condition , the stand committee of the political bureau of the ccp establish a special treatment team , in charge of his medical treatment and care .
the political bureau also specifically assign people to the task of mao zedong 's medical care , take turn with the doctor and nurse to be on constant vigil at his live quarter .
on the day of the tangshan earthquake , i.e. july 28 th , those on duty at mao zedong 's quarter be wang dongxing , wang hongwen , and mao zedong 's confidential secretary , zhang yufeng .
in the early hour of the morning , with the clock hand point to 3 @:@ 42 , the ground of zhongnanhai suddenly start to shudder .
in mao zedong 's residence , the glass window in the foyer door rattle uncontrollably , and there be a huge bang from below like a tractor start up , with mao zedong 's sickbed shake non @-@ stop.......
while mao zedong be convalesce , the employee and medical staff around him be all in a state of high tension , maintain extremely silent surroundings and atmosphere .
in normal time , apart from the talk and noise of medical instrument when the doctor revive him , not a whisper could be hear .
after the ninety , state @-@ own engineer enterprise stop recruit construction worker .
but that be n't to say they stop hire people , but those they take in be all graduate with professional diploma from polytechnic school , technical college , and university ; these staff all went into management .
during the early ninety , the formal employee of this enterprise still have complete work team , such as bricklaying team , woodwork team , steel reinforcement team , and machinery maintenance team , but since they could not cope with a large volume of project task , they be already cooperate with some migrant worker unit , in other word the familiar " contract gang ".
a collision occur between tradition and reality .
due to formal work unit no long take on young employee , work unit get increasingly older and break up .
some staff ( extremely few ) enter management .
a few exceptional former team leader gradually become project manager .
others become material officer , safety officer and quality control officer , etc.
those without connection become staff monitor the construction site------similar to the security guard of today .
the worker no long form complete operate team .
and at this time , migrant worker unit gain an opportunity to develop .
the entire on @-@ site operation work be all carry out by contract gang .
work unit disband .
the status of these worker be also change .
the corrupt mentality that treat dinner and gift @-@ give be necessary for get thing done be deeply root in the mind of people from all walk of society .
in each case of corruption , those power @-@ wield bureaucrat , those scholar or technician who have corner the market in their field , those capitalist with vast wealth , they be the rule force of this society , and also the one who profit from the corruption .
the powerless , pennyless work public with no access to information technology resource %pw be the one who lose out from the corruption .
today 's society be corrupt in every direction , and the direct cause be the reinstatement of private ownership and the scrap of the public supervision of the mao zedong era .
in privatized society , everybody trample over others try to maximize their own interest .
doctor who do n't receive ' red envelope ' have no motivation to properly cure the patient .
teacher openly ask student to give them gift ,
gang ringleader use cash to have the media make them out as hero ,
capitalist try to annex state @-@ own property team up with scholar and academically demonstrate state @-@ own monopoly to be the reason behind corruption , and then reap in the profit .
frequently the public , under the guidance of the mainstream media , only concern themselves with administrative and judicial corruption ; this in itself be a type of corruption .
do commodity price have a base value worth talk about ?
do commodity have a true value ?
these be already element of uncertainty .
with thing , less be more ; sell as much as you want , as long as somebody will buy .
in fact , in a socialist country one cannot act in that way .
in the area of profit from commodity , there have be no system in place and no legal provision ever since the reform , there be no last word on how many multiple of cost profit be allow to be , or what percentage .
china 's self @-@ sufficient , natural economy be not without any advantage . at least it do n't try to reap large profit off its own people ,
now the exact opposite be the case .
a home appliance - whether you be chinese or a foreigner , which regional category you fit in , whether you be a big city or a small city , whether you be a worker or a peasant - be always the same price .
not know how much profit be in there , not care who can afford it and who can n't , these do not seem to be the principle of socialism .
and with farmer ' grain and rural product , if the country do n't wipe out agricultural tax and do n't offer any subsidy , keep on produce be a problem .
in order to improve the people 's live standard , the government set thing so that grain be always the same price whether sell to big city or to rich people .
with this kind of ratio in existence , in struggle area try for a comfortable life be very difficult .
this issue should attract the close attention of economist .
december 26 , 1975 , mao zedong have his 82 th birth day , his last one .
upon turn 80 , mao zedong feel apparently that he be old and would die soon .
therefore , around his birthday those few year , mao zedong have always talk about life and death from time to time .
one thing he often say be : " 73 and 84 be age at which you will be go even if the king of hell do n't call you ."
also since he turn 80 , people have be pay more and more attention to mao zedong 's birthday .
within the country , people dare not celebrate his birthday publicly , so they would celebrate quietly at home .
local government dare not present gift to mao zedong , but would convey their blessing to mao zedong in various way .
in the year before mao zedong pass away , his hometown hunan would specially send thing like long life noodle on december 26 every year .
for this , mao zedong have accept with pleasure , which be quite unusual .
despite microsoft 's status as the globe 's most financially endow high @-@ tech leader , bargain with microsoft be something that be sure to leave you greatly disillusion .
microsoft 's dictionary have never contain the word " generous ".
so when the jerry yangs hope that by bargain they can bump up microsoft 's purchase price , they be be very unrealistic .
microsoft raise its price ever so slightly already represent a big concession , prove that it really do want to get its hand on yahoo ! .
ultimately choose to give it up be obviously a very painful decision for microsoft .
right from the start , this be a super acquisition that lack bite ; despite the number be huge , even if the acquisition be successful , truly revolutionize the framework of the internet be simply not possible .
however , when the acquisition do fall through , it be also quite disappointing .
to us global observer watch the bustle scene , give up the acquisition be like a play stop abruptly halfway through , without ever get the chance to watch the rest of the fun , and indeed there be no shortage of theatrical transformation .
we have no choice but to return back to our mundane life , and wait for this increasingly passion @-@ destroy industry to come up with the next affair of note .
since last september , when his daughter be diagnose with symptom such as bloody feces and kidney stone , zhou jin have be in succession to yongzhou in hunan , hebei , xiamen , beijing , guangzhou , and more to take his daughter to hospital for treatment , but the child 's illness have continue to improve and decline .
this september , zhou jin , work in shenzhen , take his daughter to the shenzhen children 's hospital for examination and treatment .
the result of the examination be that the upper rectum be severely infect and the right kidney expand . the kidney stone find in previous hospital treatment be not find this time .
zhou jin say that his daughter , a little over two year old this year , have eat sanlu milk powder for over a year . last september after the bloody feces appear , family member take his daughter to the yongzhou hospital for examination . the doctor inform them that " there be no better treatment method , just have her drink more water ."
worry about his daughter 's illness , zhou jin ask the county hospital to issue a certificate to transfer her to another hospital , to let his daughter go to a better hospital for treatment .
the hospital medical administration department tell zhou jin that issue of the certificate to transfer to another hospital would require the approval of the ministry of health , and more than one month would be need .
" i go repeatedly to find the relevant health department , but they pass my case back and forth . i be helpless and could only take my daughter to the place where i work -- xiamen , to carry out treatment ."
have to suffer this pain .
the doctor in charge tell us that the kid would be out of danger if he could just urinate .
get him to urinate could n't be more difficult !
this urine be more valuable than gold .
he do n't pee at all during the first two or three day in hospital .
we be all desperate at that time .
the hospital already arrange for him to undergo dialysis surgery .
and my satisfy son finally urinate .
out of danger at last , but one trouble pass and another one took its place , there come an acute diarrhea and fever , he be stooling several dozen time every day , you can imagine the suffer .
he have just dance a circle around the grim reaper , and encounted this problem on top of that . i be really worry he would n't pull through .
i do n't know what be happen with the injection treatment at the hospital - the more they inject him the worse the diarrhea , nothing would stop it .
after a few more day of treatment , the kid 's diarrhea be a little better and the doctor get him to do an ultrasound .
the kidney stone have be wash out by the medicine . there be no more stone on his kidney .
the hospitalization be very expensive and our family could n't afford it , so we have no choice but to leave the hospital and go home .
on the night of dragon boat festival he pass out a stone by himself , it be a sedimentary one .
the whole family be really excite , we all think he be better , that he be cure .
over 200 han pupil in 15 th primary school in urumqi be inject , *and there be actually uyghur student from the same school involved*, it be shock !
on the day of september 1 st alone , at the entrance of " longyuan supermarket " on urumqi 's friendship road , two people be inject and sent to hospital .
on the same day , in shuimogou district , no.106 bus have just pull up at the gaojiazhuang stop when several people be inject , soon , the uyghur assailant jump from the bus and flee , but they be soon detain after bystander give chase .
the 920 and many other bus also experience a number of poison syringe case .
on august 31 , the no. 17 bus explode near xibei road , while the no. 14 bus be bomb at the same time .
nevertheless , all news be block .
but witness shortly after spread the news to the outside world by telephone - urumqi security be extremely deteriorate !
even more ironic be in late august , when *president hu jintao* have just visit xinjiang on an inspection tour . upon his return to beijing , the situation in urumqi be far from settle , instead the *uyghur terrorists* become even more rampant , and the number of attack and bombings be increase rather than decrease !
the incompetence of the xinjiang government would make the central extremely troublesome !
listen to yesterday once more by the carpenter , see the photograph album in which photo show collage of compatriot receive award , i do n't know when people should cry , and my heart be lose .
after so many year can they still sing yesterday once more ?
dear friend , let me fill in some of the word for the melody right now in my heart .
do n't worry , the cold @-@ blood be n't me , it 's a part of my heart .
if an olympic game be hold take the damage done to mankind by industrial pollution as theme , i think our dear motherland should be able to win a gold medal and a champion of win the grand total in gold medal . i just do n't know how the open ceremony would be run , how volunteer should be recruit , or which song should be sing lustily .
the title of the sick man of east asia once go far away follow the revolutionary course brim with victory , but after see this group of photo , i feel that they have whistle back with this brand new attitude of faster , higher , stronger .
what be different be that i dare not expect for ; in what way can we have again " the destruction of opium at humen " with " uphold the country 's interest with one 's life ".
because we and our motherland cannot depart from this shock pollution . what we can do be just to improve , adjust and vaguely hope .
the people who have be sacrifice have , without choice , use their life to pave the road to success for another group of people .
at that time , ten of thousand of city youth head to the countryside , but by no mean be all of them be true believer .
some be under pressure to show their " revolutionary zeal ", others go because there be no job in the city .
the poverty and backwardness of the countryside be appal , and most of the educate youth become disillusion .
in the middle of the 1970 's the intensity of the cultural revolution wane , and one after one the youth return to the city or go to study in university , but back then there be n't an exam to get into university , it depended on your political background and behavior .
jianguo be not one of these . he work for seven year in a rural part of inner mongolia , become a village head , and be very popular with the local .
he be a dab hand at work the field , and could match the local when it come to drink spirit .
he marry an old school friend of his from beijing , and she stay behind for him , the two live their own little life together in the country .
although the villager have no interest in the various kind of " revolutionary practice " that jianguo try to make them adopt , he be honest and kind , and his generous personality won their friendship and affection .
after jianguo have return to beijing for not even a few moth , the student movement in tiananmen begin .
jianguo go to the square to listen to speech and sing , and watch a new generation of student be rebellious , and be shake and move .
twenty year before , the god of the " red guard " be mao , but the ideal of young people now be wear jeans and a t @-@ shirt , and a new statue have be erect : lady liberty .
at that time i live in beijing , and every day go to the square . when we run into each other , jianguo do n't say much . however it look like he have a million thought stir in his heart .
one afternoon , i go to see an active figure in the square , and arrange to go together with him .
friend greet me with smile , and ask me to go into their tent , as a meet of student leader be go on inside .
jianguo be just behind me and have just start to come inside , when my friend frown and stop him : " no , you can n't come inside ! "
i explain , say this be my brother . my friend listen with surprise .
beijing @-@ born and beijing @-@ raise jianguo , he look today completely like a villager from the countryside .
wang peirong think that this be relate to blockage in the usual report channel .
he point out , all of his report be make under the circumstance that the normal report do n't work , and he have no choice but make report online .
a typical example be that the fall of dong feng , the most debaucherous secretary labeled as one @-@ husband @-@ with @-@ two @-@ wife in the country .
wang peirong think that dong feng 's absurdity and corruption be actually an open secret , but nobody investigate and penalize ; and even though wang peirong report on this use his real name to the concern department for one year , no one bother to inquire about it .
wang peirong also think that report online be equivalent to publicize the corruptive deed of the person be report against . once under the public eye , the possibility of any blatant cover @-@ up become greatly reduce , thus , make it easier to investigate and penalize .
many people will ask , chargeback rival be make by an individual , so what be the relationship with 360?
there be likely three original reason why 360 use a person 's name to issue chargeback rival :
general manager zhou have do too much bad stuff on pc 's , and do n't want to offend too many people on cell phone , so he find an individual author to act as a scapegoat ( if a cell phone sp company know that it be 360 that block their way . each one of them be tough.);
use an individual author to issue it , it be easy to defraud the grassroots netizens of their sense of identification and sympathy .
if you see i be an individual netizen , who have be charge money , so make a piece of software in order to help everyone solve this problem , then how move it seem from the outside .
use an individual author to issue , there have be a strong power of captivation . many company in the sp and wireless realm would definitely think that a product from an individual author would not have much influence , so would not pay too much attention to it .
nevertheless , 360 already do this under cover of promote chargeback rival in large scale . once after chargeback rival become dominant on the situation , then it be to be transform into 360 .
have see no hope from xu ming , wang peirong then could only post the relevant problem online .
not only that , wang peirong 's generous and courageous endeavors have lead to revenge from the report on numerous occasion : when report the corruption of li rongqi , he be severely beat up by hire goon ; when report the black force , he be retaliate by the black force , and hospitalize for the injury .
but these have not be able to halt the momentum of wang peirong 's report .
however , in the program , wang peirong call out to the party and the government to set out policy and provision to protect the personal safety and legal right of whistle blower .
this program of <<news night banquet>> on jiangsu tv 's city channel , cause a great uproar in the community .
but in contrast with this , wang peirong , well repute as jiangsu 's " number one person in online anti @-@ corruption ", be now suffer unfair treatment .
because of pressure from the report official such as li rongqi , china 's university of mine and technology have suspend wang peirong 's teach duty .
how china university of mine and technology respond to jiangsu mainstream media 's positive and active appraisal of wang peirong ; how well they treat wang peirong ; and how they protect wang peirong 's legal right , be unavoidable question place in front of the mine university 's decision maker .
the chinese defense budget for 2012 be rmb 670.274 billion , increase by rmb 67.604 billion and 11.2 % compare to the previous year 's estimate budgetary expenditure .
the chinese military expenditure be increase too fast for america , and the increase be currently over rmb 100 billion , but what on earth can china do with this additional amount of more than rmb 100 billion dollar ?
based on the current exchange rate between the renminbi and us dollar , it amount to more than us $ 10 billion , which can purchase more than a hundred of the latest 3.5 generation western fighter plane .
if it be use to manufacture chinese j @-@ 10 fighter , over two hundred plane can be produce , or perhaps even more . in one go , china can improve its prowess in the air by a margin even greater than the total sum of a mid @-@ size western country .
in fact , what america really fear be not the increase of military expenditure , but rather the rapid rate at which china be upgrade its military technology , which may enable china to overtake america soon .
compare to america , china have many inadequacy , for instance , its high technology development be not as mature as america 's , and its basic infrastructure , the standard of education of its citizen , development of its system and so on be also lack . however , china have its own natural advantage , and that be china possess a long history and stability of culture .
some people point out in their comment that this be a serious disadvantage to china when compare to america , as they say that china be carry too heavy a burden which will hinder rapid development ,
in fact , this reason be extremely incorrect , the chinese culture be profound , so whatever problem the country may face , it can draw on its historic experience ,
for instance , when china deal with international affair , it can learn from how the yuan dynasty handle foreign trade and the problem of co @-@ existence between multiple ethnic group , or it could at least draw a lesson from the negative experience .
currently america be drastically cut down on its military expenditure , however it fear that china will substantially increase its military expenditure . america be desperately attempt to return to the pacific ocean as it wish to continue to contain the growth of chinese military strength ,
america control the strait of malacca , and a large majority of china 's ship vessel be under its control . however if america wish to maintain the development of world trade order , its expense will naturally be enormous .
if it be not for the financial crisis , a number of western country have state that they would not have consider budgetary issue for american military deployment .
as a matter of fact , neighboring country need not be too sensitive to the sharp increase in chinese military spend . they fear that china will pose a direct threat to them , but chinese history have show that china have never have the habit of wield its military might to challenge western country , but as for how they habitually view china will depend on the profound influence of the chinese culture .
china do not like to show off , prefer to restrain itself , and the same be true in the field of military matter .
up to now , china reveal that it have three model of the 4 th generation stealth fighter plane under research and development , and the j20 be expect to enter mass production and service next year , which be a direct blow to america ,
however , what be even more terrify for america be that this chinese fighter plane model have already display surprisingly advance performance during combat , and it be fear that its level of technological advancement cannot be match by the f22. after all , this model of fighter plane have never participate in actual inspection up to this point .
perhaps this be understandable for china , but it be inevitable that the 4 th generation chinese fighter plane would create a stir .
the original order have be disrupt . after all , the chinese fighter be no less powerful than the american one .
accord to american media report , china 's military expenditure be expect to reach us $ 200 billion in two year ' time ,
of course there be a strong possibility that this number have be greatly exaggerate , and it be also embellish by the china threat theory . however , such move by america no longer have much effect on china , even if the chinese defense expenditure reach us $ 200 billion , america cannot do anything to china ,
recently , china adopt an aggressive stance , cast negative vote on the syria issue three time , and in relation to japan 's name of the diaoyu island , beijing appear to be send a message that ' we have accumulate sufficient power , and we be not afraid of your distortion of the truth .'
the chinese military expenditure be soar . by contrast , america be continuously cut down on its military expenditure , repeatedly assert that its prowess will be replace by small but elite troop that will not affect its capability . as it be nothing more than self @-@ consolation , therefore , it cause widespread concern throughout america .
certainly , this be clearly a refurbished version of the ' military threat theory ' from america , and it be now change to a ' threat by military expenditure theory ', however , china be use to finger @-@ wag and criticism from america , and as china grow increasingly confident , this writer believe that america will terminate its friendly economic relation with china soon or later ,
china 's soar military expenditure imply that china be reluctant to be limit to a position as the world 's no. 2 , and nor be it content to be world no. 1 in name only . instead , it intend to recover its historical 1,500 @-@ year glory as the leader of the world .
the content be not quite the same as the title ...
let me whisper this : do business in america depends on connection , and red packet be also accepted~same as in china ... :)
face with rascal and hooligan like the americans , the chinese have no choice but to arm themselves .
indeed . i wonder what our military expenditure be like in proportion to america 's , and besides how much of our military expenditure be genuinely spend on sophisticated national defenses , if it be really spend on advanced defenses , there will never be such a thing as too much ! compare to america we be still lag far behind !
now that vice president xi have visit america , the direction for the sino @-@ american relationship have become the focus of world attention .
but no matter how sweetly imperialist america talk , i have no hope for imperialist america .
imperialist america have always be a country fail to live up to its word , and as long as something be in its interest , it will spare no effort and use any mean to get it .
the relationship between china and imperialist america be like that between the sheep and the wolf , and do n't expect the wolf to change its ambition ,
the wolf and the sheep can never be friend , even if so , it 's only an illusion on our part , it 's only a wolf in sheep 's clothe .
ultimately , it will reveal its wolf nature , and i hope the sheep will not be fool by it .
the whole world expect china and america to coexist peacefully , jointly preside over and deal with international affair , and build a peaceful new international order .
the peaceful coexistence of china and america be also the common wish of the people in the two country .
nevertheless , the peace we aspire to will be only our good wish .
china be the fallen petal that have the intention , but imperialist america be the heartless flow water .
maintain friendly relation with imperialist america be only the wishful think of some chinese !
though there be a great distance between china and america and there be no territorial dispute , unlike our relationship with the polar bear , there be a direct conflict of interest .
however , due to ideological difference between china and america and the lack of the necessary trust and communication in handle international affair , it be particularly imperialist america , in its effort to contain the development of china and its threat to its hegemonic position , that make trouble wherever possible to constrain the takeoff of the chinese dragon .
actually , imperialist america have the initiative in term of whether the two major country , china and america can get along ,
china have do a lot , and sacrifice a lot , for the sino @-@ american relationship ,
out of its wishful think , china use its warm face to caress the cold ass of imperialist america , but it be still unable to win imperialistic america 's sincerity , cause the sino @-@ american relationship to waver and even fall backwards .
in future time , as china challenge its world hegemony and imperialist america attempt to retain it , more clash will happen , conflict will be inevitable , and the struggle will become ever more ferocious .
in recent year , as china 's reform and open @-@ up campaign have reach greater depth , the people 's live standard have improve substantially , and its defense and military strength have also develop rapidly .
the status of china as a major world power have begin to be more prominent , and in deal with and direct international affair , china have play an ever more important role .
china 's rapid growth and rise have gradually threaten and challenge the hegemonic position of imperialist america .
this make imperialist america restless , and it have devise every possible mean to contain and check china 's development .
imperialist america want to upset and restrain china with its military sale to taiwan and the taiwan issue !
the taiwan issue have become an everlasting sorrow in the heart of all descendant of china .
imperialist america want to control the middle east and suppress syria and iran mainly because it covet the important strategic location and abundant resource of the middle east .
imperialist america want to overthrow the bashar regime to get rid of the polar bear 's only military base in the middle east ! it do not want the influence of the polar bear to exist in the middle east region over the long term .
imperialist america want to topple iran mainly to take on china , to control china 's resource and contain china 's development .
in addition , it also want to suppress the polar bear and squeeze the live space of china and russia .
in today 's world , the only country that can constitute a threat to the hegemonic position of imperialist america be china and , to a lesser degree , the polar bear .
imperialist america have have far @-@ reach strategic foresight , and each step it take serve to consolidate its hegemony .
imperialist america be suppress china in an all @-@ round way , and we can see imperialist america 's meddle presence in the economy , politics and military affair .
imperialist america have be support little japan , india , the philippine servant and the vietnamese monkey , disturbing the stable environment around china to disrupt the peaceful development and rise of china .
imperialist america be now pompously return to the asia pacific region and reshuffle its military deployment , directly targeting china .
taiwan be the deepest pain for all chinese , because imperialist america have long take taiwan as a pawn and use it as a bargain chip in the struggle with china .
it 's a pity that many chinese be still hope to make friend with imperialist america and maintain a friendship with imperialist america from generation to generation .
furthermore , the many strategic adjustment and idea of imperialist america be all aim at the rise china .
many advance weapon have be tailor @-@ make for china .
compatriot ! wake up ! imperialist america have already aim its gun to our head , do not keep daydream !
imperialist america take china as its prime rival and enemy , give up your fantasy that you can make friend with the enemy !
the best method be to make good use of our time to step up our own defense and military construction , cast away all the illusion , and get ready for war !
our ancestor wisely say , " harbor no ill intention against others , but never relax one 's vigilance "!
this be the necessary psychology for get along with friend , but at this moment imperialist america be our enemy stare like a tiger watch its prey , make it more necessary for us to remain vigilant at this time !
china have make a lot of sacrifice to improve its relation with imperialist america , and china have all along tried to become friend with imperialist america ,
although china now need a peaceful and stable environment for its development , we can n't make continual investment without any return .
can sino @-@ american relation be improve ? is friendly development possible ? the key question lie with imperialist america , not china .
imperialist america have always hold the initiative in the development of sino @-@ american relation .
in fact , it be not difficult for china and america to become friend , because china and america , despite their ideological difference , have no land or territorial dispute .
though china and america have fight each other on the battlefield , the war be not directly between china and america .
if imperialist america sincerely want to make friend with china , it must display its sincerity and let the chinese people see actual action and result .
for china , the greatest interest concern imperialist america lie in the taiwan issue .
if imperialist america can stop its military sale to taiwan , provide no support to taiwan , and ensure peace across the taiwan strait , it will allow china to accomplish its great cause of national reunification .
if it refrain from meddle in china 's internal human right issue , and also do not intervene in other affair such as tibet , i believe that china will also sacrifice its other interest to reciprocate the good faith of imperialist america !
only if imperialist america do this can china and america truly become friend and co @-@ exist peacefully as friend from generation to generation .
will imperialist america give up taiwan ? absolutely not !
be use to be a hegemon , imperialist america like to intervene in the internal affair and human right affair of other country , and taiwan be the best chess piece for contain china , so i believe imperialist america will not easily let go of it !
there be even less possibility that it will tolerate a chinese challenge to its position as the world hegemon !
in the year to come , instead of become friend , china and america will only become rival and even enemy !
therefore , it 's unnecessary to harbor any fantasy about imperialist america , china should fundamentally change its mentality , there be no need to fear imperialist america , and we should be ready for a military confrontation with imperialist america at any time .
let 's win the respect of imperialist america and the whole world with our strength .
a peaceful rise be only our unilateral notion , because the big power of the world will not accept the appearance of a powerful china .
only baptize by war can china really become a world power .
the chinese should be ever vigilant and not be deceive by the present peace , active war preparation be the only right choice ,
only when our defense and military have become strong , will we be able to eradicate all aggressor , and only through the baptism of war can china become a truly powerful country .
in my personal opinion , there must be a war between china and america in the future !
what china need to do be to cast away its illusion and get ready for war .
china mobile be no doubt a monopolized operator in china , the biggest mobile phone market in the world . it have also express clearly its ambition to step outside the country and participate in global competition .
even though the performance of chinese company be not outstanding in the course of globalization , wang jianzhou , president and ceo of china mobile , be determine to change all this .
on the eve of the business week ceo forum hold in beijing on november 1 , wang jianzhou give an exclusive interview to the editor of the business week .
he state that the objective of china mobile be to become a world @-@ class company .
wang jianzhou , 57 , say in fluent english that china mobile , which be list on the hong kong stock exchange , have close to 300 million mobile phone user in mainland china , an equivalent of the entire population of the unite state .
this signify that china mobile occupy almost 70 percent of the market share in mainland china .
li yanhong , zhang chaoyang , shen nanpeng , ma huateng...
in the past 10 year , behind these chinese high @-@ tech magnate who emerge one after another be sure to be the shadow of the u.s. own international data group ( idg ) .
the annual idg conference be hold in sanya , hainan on november 3 .
apart from the seven partner , who be call the ' seven sword ' inside idg , the participant also include over 190 ceos of company that idg invest in and representative from investment bank and consult agency .
accord to the practice of the past six year , after each idg conference , there will always be some participant who make the list of magnate of the year .
i insist on not pay him . finally , he crack and flee in panic .
however , i be also at the verge of collapse because the people 's police at 110 whom i look forward to still have not arrive yet .
these day , overseas study have become popular . to friend and relative , it 's a proud thing to be mention .
children of the rich and government official , who do n't want to enhance their status through overseas study ?
let alone that get oneself a western diploma will make get a good job easier in the future . even old dad and mom make a parade of it everywhere would look exceedingly good !
however , those in middle class family or even lay @-@ off worker see those children of the wealthy and powerful go overseas , come back cloak in glory and all have a good future ( they do n't know that family wealth and good background of those be the only real guarantee ) . how wonderful ! thereupon , they pinch and scrape to send their child overseas ,
it seem that once they be send overseas , nothing but a wonderful future and unlimited glory will return .
nowadays , it be more often the case that those who do n't pass the university entrance exam and be waste their day at home without do anything be send overseas . with a bit of " toughen up ", everything will be okay .
wrong ! with a huge chunk of cash spent , the frighten thing be that the payoff fall far short of expectation .
even more frighten be that it hold the child back .
i 've be in france for several year !
what i have experience myself or , even more , what i have see be the countless who have give up their study year by year , those with wrecked health everywhere , those who sell their soul and even those who lost their life .
overseas study be a splendid term , but in return it demand youth , effort and staunch perseverance , as well as sufficient rationality .
life be never a bed of rose in any location , even more in a foreign land where there be a language barrier , different custom and no family or friend .
malformed society
the proposal on " the transfer of reproduction right " be originate from the same track the proposal on " control the number of rural children go to college "! what else be these representative if not do @-@ nothing politician ?
fuck you ! go to hell ! fuck your mother !
complete and obvious bullshit ! more sinister than directly sell and buy infant !
can china still be save ?
the one @-@ child policy be the most insidious policy , thoroughly antihuman and racially discriminatory , an open trample on the right of survival right for han people as a whole . those who formulate and implement this policy be all fascist ; they should be bring to trial at the international court , and the people principally responsible for it should be hang .
this guy really be a " representative ", a @-@ ha .
as know to all , shanghai and hong kong have very low birth rate and mainly depend on migrant to maintain their population size and keep their population young ; there be good economic development ;
in recent year , due to labor shortage , million of black people and southeast asians have come to the southeast , and have cause vary degree of deterioration in social order .
just like shanghai and hong kong , china depends on immigrant and at the same time pursue the one @-@ child policy , make the plan policy look like a very clever policy !
shanghai and hong kong maintain their social development by absorb migrant from other province , what will happen if china prepare herbal medicine by the prescribe method and absorb foreigner ?
do n't wait till the situation have become unmanageable and then drive away the gypsies as sarkozy do ; german chancellor angela merkel have just recently declare that germany have fail to build a diversified society and will limit the development of the immigrant population ; now that the sheep have be steal , no choice but to mend the fold !
before long , the dividend for the population would wear out . as immigrant laborers swarm in ( these people be not subject to family plan ) , the population would soon experience racial replacement , and china , as yugoslavia do , would soon disintegrate !
the black , arabs , and vietnamese , one after another , would demand their right , autonomy , and independence !
one after another , the local area would become independent , as kosovo do !
the minority people in xinjiang and tibet can bear more children , cause the proportion of the han people compare to the population of the frontier ethnic region to decline quickly ;
the regiment of troop and sichuan women that such national hero as zuo zongtang and wang zhen take great pain to transplant into xinjiang and tibet be be quickly exterminate by the one @-@ child policy ; the undercurrent of xinjiang independence and tibetan independence be get ever more rampant !
the family plan policy and the one @-@ child policy have put the country in an dangerous as stack egg , and pose a threat to the survival of the nation .
family plan have effectively reduce the chinese population by 300 million , postponing the day of 7 billion by 3 year ; accord to the plan of the plan commission , even if the chinese population be reduce by 1 billion , the day of 7 billion will be postpone for just another few year !
but the chinese nation will be on the brink of extinction . such selfless notion which nobody will have until evolve into a nonhuman creature , surprisingly , have become a reality in china !
the issue of population and ethnical structure be major issue for the survival of the country !
family plan be part of the plan to massively exterminate the han people , and the begin of divide china !
the family plan policy be extremely stupid and the ultimate in self @-@ castration . it be unprecedented from a historic perspective and will be unmatchable in the future ; and in the global perspective , it be totally unique !
the self @-@ harm policy fully embody the malice of the enemy and the stupidity of the those in power , bring disaster to both the country and the people , be totally void of conscience , contribute nothing to the contemporary time , leave a legacy of trouble for a long time in future , and will definitely become a joke that those throughout all history will ridicule !
the other day , xinwen lianbo report that the difficulty for enterprise to hire worker have extend to the west and sweep the whole country !
the family plan policy be extremely stupid , bring disaster to both the country and the people , and be totally void of conscience !
improve population quality require transfer reproduction right to the rich ?
through free exchange on the market , nearly everything can be buy and sell .
today , the right to bear a second child be also become a popular product with the rich .
they have money to buy the right , to bear the child , and to raise the child .
as to these transfer and transaction of the right to bear a second child , let 's have a look at how the representative argue and legally struggle with government official at the " two meeting ".
why do they propose such a transfer on the right to bear a second child ?
to this question , li xinghao @-@ the author of this proposal , npc representative and chairman of zhigao group , say that such a transfer be beneficial to improve the quality of the population .
transfer to which kind of person , exactly ?
this representative identify 3 group : first , people with strong educational background ; second , the rich class ; third , civil servant .
li xinghao assert that " in today 's society , people with strong educational background , the rich class , and civil servant have relatively high social status , relatively good economics mean , and can ensure basic educational condition and a good environment for the newborn population to develop in ".
why be such transfer practical ?
li xinghao give his own specific explanation from the angle of market supply and demand .
he say , " for a transfer , people be not classify into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not .
he say that the original motive for this proposal be root in his discovery that some family legally allow to bear a second child , due to their poverty and other reason , would become even more impoverished if they be to do so ;
while some rich family have a strong desire to bear a second child but do not have the allowance to do so .
he think that this conflict really exist , and the relevant governmental department can take the initiative to establish a transfer platform ."
this transfer proposal by representative li be indeed very smart .
on the one hand , it help the government to reduce and narrow the gap of wealth ;
on the other hand , it also solve the structural conflict of the reproduction right market @-@ the poor have allowance but cannot afford the birth and upbringing , while the rich want to bear children but do n't have the allowance .
based on representative li 's proposal , the rich will voluntarily reduce their per capita wealth by bear and raise more children , while the poor will increase their per capita wealth by bear and raise fewer children .
through such transfer and transaction of the right to bear a second child between the rich and the poor , the government can unnoticeably narrow the ever @-@ increase gap between the poor and the rich without spend a single cent .
how can the wealth gap be narrow through such transfer ?
this representative li have envision a fast track for the get @-@ rich @-@ first people to guide and assist the get @-@ rich @-@ later people . that be , " the allowance transferee shall give the transferor ' an entire sequence ' of help and support ."
" accord to li xinghao 's plan , through lottery @-@ type draw , the transfer platform establish a one @-@ on @-@ one guidance and assistance relationship between the transferee and the transferor .
as part of the assistance , the couple apply for the allowance to be transfer in to them will buy the transfer couple all the basic insurance currently require by the government , include social insurance , medical insurance , and personal accident insurance , and will continue to provide them with a minimum live guarantee for the rest of their life .
meanwhile , the applicant couple will also provide financial support for the education of the transfer couple 's child until he or she graduate from university .
what 's more , if the transfer couple intend to register as permanent urban resident , the applicant couple shall buy them a 35m2 socially subsidize apartment in the city where the applicant dwell , but all of the transfer couple 's land use right in the countryside will belong to the applicant couple ."
what do our family plan official think of this proposal that the state " utilize the transfer of right to bear a second @-@ child to improve the population quality and make the get @-@ rich @-@ first help the get @-@ rich @-@ later so as to realize common prosperity "?
in response , " yesterday , zhang feng , director of guangdong provincial family plan commission , make his stance clear to the media that the right to reproduce be absolutely not transferrable .
in the event that the right to reproduce be transfer , it would not only be a violation of law , but also bring moral question if it involve a transaction ."
through transfer their right to bear a second child and the concomitant obligation impose on the transferees , the poor can get rich with the guidance and assistance from the get @-@ rich @-@ first class , if the proposal can pass and become law , the poor undoubtedly have find in the rich class , well @-@ educate class , and the bureaucratic class an obedient son to provide for them up until they die . marvelous indeed .
he claim it be not a transaction , but how can it be otherwise ? in this bundle of obligation for common prosperity , where be the dignity of the poor ?
do not the bundle of obligation propose by this representative li still imply a contract on the exchange and transaction of land use right ?
certainly , without such exchange of interest , why would the rich take an interest in provide for the children of the poor ?
if the legislature really want to adopt this proposal on the premise of the get @-@ rich @-@ first class lead the get @-@ rich @-@ later class to become rich by give them one @-@ on @-@ one guidance and assistance so as to improve our population quality and narrow our wealth gap , it must ensure fairness in such exchange of interest and during the transfer .
transfer together with a wet nurse .
follow it with interest .
for a transfer of the right to marry , people be not classify into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not . since i discover that some men who have a legal right to marry , due to their poverty and other reason , would become even more impoverished if they do marry ;
while some rich men have a strong desire to marry n concubine ( because their mistress often fuss about want to get marry ) but they do not have the allowance , and would be guilty of bigamy .
i think that this conflict really exist , and the relevant governmental department can take the initiative to establish a platform to transfer the right to marry .
pillage the flesh till the bone be see ?
interest ... interesting

a pack of luxury cigarette range from as little as a few ten of yuan to more than a hundred yuan , if you smoke a stick , you be puff away one month 's salary for an ordinary worker .
if it be buy with public fund , it may be say that what they be smoke be not cigarette but the " blood and sweat " of the taxpayers .
npc representative ma wenfang propose that consumption of tobacco product on public expense should be universally ban .
there be of course many reason as to why we lag far behind in meet our tobacco control objective .
but one of the undisputable reason be that a huge smoker 's group exist within our huge contingent of civil servant .
among this legion of smoker , a considerable number smoke " free cigarette " which they do n't have to buy with their own money , as they be receive as gift or buy with public fund .
it be precisely because they be not use their own money that they usually smoke luxury cigarette which be unaffordable for most people .
their track performance for blow smoke ring also have a compound effect in repeatedly set new record for consumption expense by civil servant , and it have become an organic portion of officialdom corruption as a whole .
it be precisely this horrify social backdrop that prompt npc representative ma wenfang to solemnly set forth her proposal that consumption of tobacco product on public fund be universally ban .
in our country , there be many civil servant who think their family name be " gong " and such that every expense incur by them , regardless of whether it be for public or private purpose , should be bear by the public . therefore , consumption on public expense can involve almost everything imaginable .
for instance , besides luxury cigarette , other example include luxury liquor , fine wining and dine , luxury car , and overseas tour , and whatever luxury enjoyment and extravagant entertainment they can imagine , they would want to have them all and enjoy them to full , use public fund to settle the bill in full .
if the supreme authority have to draw up separate regulatory document to address every single item for consumption on public expense for nationwide circulation in order to check such extravagance , the mountain of document will really extend towards the sky .
in fact , all that need to be do be to clearly include tobacco product within the anti @-@ corruption regulation ' relevant clause for prohibition of consumption on public fund , and it will suffice .
as for the remain issue , we must ensure that the order and prohibition be fully enforce . if any civil servant dare to violate the law , he will be severely punish accord to the law and regulation .
if this be really carry out in all locality at every level , there would be no cause to worry that the corrupt practice of consumption on public expense , include smoke on public fund , cannot be curb .
after deputy and committee member have move into their quarter in the hotel , how would service staff greet them ?
some greet them with " deputy so @-@ and @-@ so " or " committee member so @-@ and @-@ so ; " while some call npc deputy " chief , " which make some deputy , especially deputy from the grass @-@ root level , feel somewhat embarrass . some deputy even request service staff to " not call me chief ."
call deputy and committee member who have move into their quarter in the hotel " chief " be , of course , out of the hotel service staff member 's formal respect , but it have actually cause misunderstand of the identity of deputy or committee member .
as major national event , the convene of the two conference have clearly provide the path ahead for our development .
however , at the two conference , accord to common sense , the identity of " deputy " or " committee member " be generally use , that be , " deputy xx " or " committee member xx." but i cannot say much for the mention of " deputy as a chief ."
through the subtlety of greet , we can see common people 's sense of awe towards " deputy " and " committee member ."
actually , when provide service to deputy and committee member , what 's wrong with be a bit simple ?
would n't it appear more cordial to directly greet them as " deputy xx " or " committee member xx ? "
after greet them as chief , do n't you have a sense of awe and awkwardness ?
as deputy , they should equally treasure their own first identity . deputy or committee member be neither an administrative official post nor a honorary title . this identity mean enormous responsibility .
at the " time of the two conference , " deputy and committee member should have an even heighten sense of responsibility . no matter what kind of social status you yourself have , remember firmly your own first identity and most important identity be a deputy , a committee member .
this be just a tidbit at the two conference . the conference that follow will unfold more exciting content in front of us .
they be scumbags
gosh , they even dare to use the word ' awe .' common people could n't wait to ' despise ' them , how could they have a sense of ' awe ? '
what would you say , which thingy there be publicly elect by common people form by the first , second , and third person such as you , me , and him ?
before the two national conference be convene , various major news websites and periodical across the country in succession invite netizens and reader nationwide to submit " suggestion for the two conference ."
this writer from " suggestion for the two conference " submit by netizens across the country on various major news websites on the central government 's strengthen of effort to oppose corruption and promote honest government , better supervision of the government and official , and severe punishment for people engage in embezzlement and corruption .
when cppcc delegate mao xinyu check in to attend the " two conference " and spoke of a motion he propose this year , he say the emphasis be on anti @-@ corruption effort .
the anti @-@ corruption drive involve everyone , from the ordinary people below up to and include the delegate to the two conference .
at present , public expenditure on food and entertainment nationwide have already reach 300 billion a year .
such a huge figure for public expenditure on food and entertainment crowd out expenditure on thing vital for people 's welfare , include education , hygiene , healthcare , and social security .
figure list in a bill draw up by the jiusan society 's central organization before the two conference in 2012
be really unbelievable : annual public expenditure on food and entertainment actually reach 300 billion ! how large be this figure of 300 billion ?
if we save this 300 billion and invest it in the economically undeveloped and impoverish region in china , how many school could we build ?
how many poor family could we assist ? how many children force to leave school could we assist ?
it 's a pity that this 300 billion be squander with no result , waste in the pursuit of debauchery , by corrupt official - how could our people not hate the " parasite " hide among the membership rank of the communist party ?
when corruption among government official be bring up , the ordinary people all gnash their teeth , but the ordinary people be , after all , the ordinary people , and can only look on helplessly in silent fury .
the ordinary people cannot afford to upset government official , for if the ordinary people dare to upset government official , they would be crack egg against rock . not only could they get more than they bargain for ; if something go wrong , they could end up in prison , or even endanger their life .
every year , there be case across the country where ordinary people , because of report government official , suffer the disaster of imprisonment if they get up lightly or the disaster of death if they be dealt with harshly .
it be common for ordinary people , with no other mean of redress , to post on the internet out of resentment against savage land requisition or the savage demolition of home and force relocation by local government official , but what fate do they often bring on themselves ?
local government official easily pin some label on you , and you can even be chase and arrest by public security body across provincial boundary .
the most terrible thing be not the government official , but the power that lie in the hand of these official .
how can we prevent the " three type of consumption on public fund ? "
if we be to prevent the " three type of consumption on public fund , " we must first " block " the official ' mouth ,
but this be easier say than done . why ?
as people work in a lower @-@ level work unit , if leader from higher @-@ level work unit come , do you dare not to entertain them in the most respectful way with nice thing to eat and drink ?
if they be not entertain well with nice thing to eat and drink , after they 've go , will official in the lower @-@ level work unit still have a future ?
to their subordinate , senior leader be all their " masters." you can n't afford to upset any of them , and whoever upset them be in for it . if you rub them up the wrong way when you 're try to butter them up , you won't just jeopardize your official position , you won't even know what the consequence will be .
to stop the " three type of consumption on public fund , " senior official must first " block " their own mouth .
in april 2011 , when the no. 6 inspection group of hubei 's provincial party committee go to yichang city on an inspection tour of zigui county , a national @-@ level impoverish county , the local government official be both delight and worry .
what delight them be that they have an opportunity to report their problem to senior leader and have them take seriously by them , and what worry them be that there be 13 people in the inspection group , come for 20 day or so , and the entertainment expense , the cost of the gift , and the inspection fee and various other item of expenditure would altogether come to 801,900 yuan .
how could this national @-@ level impoverish county pay the bill ?
this example be the best illustration that if we be to prevent the " three type of consumption on public fund , " we must first stop the senior government official .
if the upper beam be correctly place , the lower beam will not go awry .
if the central state authority be to stop the " three type of consumption on public fund , " they must dare to do what they mean .
it should be say that wining and dine on public fund as point out by scholar be an objective reality .
with the increase prevalence of the alcohol culture at the grass @-@ root institution , alcohol have already be ferment and adulterate by the so @-@ call " bureaucratic culture " beyond recognition .
some people put on high @-@ end wine banquet try to please their superior , some people use alcohol as gift to seek personal gain , some people consider it a type of pleasure to get people to drink by use beer game , and some people get carry away because of their addiction to alcohol or drunkenness , adversely affect their work .
every year the amount of food trashed and money waste as a result of wining and dine on public fund be even more appal .
this writer have live for a long time at the grass @-@ root level and often heard and witness some grass @-@ root official almost sit at meal gathering or attend banquet every day , and never get tire of it .
how much be the wining and dine expense at the grass @-@ root level in one year ? a specific number be virtually never publish .
actually , the insider be well aware that this be a considerably high expenditure .
who should be blame for the grass @-@ root official ' wining and dine become common practice ?
speak with regard to the grass @-@ root level , it be indeed necessary to conduct rectification and to straighten thing up accord to the relevant regulation , but focusing on the grass @-@ root level alone may not be enough .
throughout the year , various type of inspection group and investigation group , as numerous as the hair on an ox , come and go in an endless stream , also make the grass @-@ root institution overburden . some grass @-@ root lead cadre , with no choice but to run between the various dinner party every day , also feel somewhat helpless .
there be also many people wallow in the array of wine glass and poker chip become " vessel for wine and bag for food ."
this writer met with some township official . face more and more dinner party , many of them be feed up with it , but also feel force and helpless .
the reason they explain be that entertain be just for solve problem .
a township official , use his finger to count , tell this writer that in order to solve financial , road repair , canal construction project and so on , they must entertain the relevant personnel and department head , otherwise it will be of no avail .
when i look back to all these year , the urban construction in beijing have experience rapid development .
some people say that it borrow the easterly wind of the olympics . however , i think otherwise .
even though the 2008 olympics allow beijing to display its charisma in front of camera of all caliber that frocked in from all side ,
it have almost be four year since the olympics and the urban development in beijing still have not stop .
speak of urban development , the most representative one be none other than the beijing subway .
those who be born and raise in beijing in the 80 s can almost be call the generation who grow up sit on the subway .
the public transportation then could not be consider as convenient compare to now . bus could hardly be say as provide easy access to all direction .
however , with their extensive coverage , the two subway line provide novelty and convenience to many beijing resident and visitor who travel from afar .
the subway be a distinguish traffic feature of beijing . as one of the first chinese city to have underground transportation , the emergence of subway have provide everyone more choice .
this underground railway line that run through eastern and western beijing have become beijing 's symbol of alternative culture .
day by day , beijing be develop , so be its public transport and highway . eventually , it will usher in the alarm data of 5 million car in 2012 .
meanwhile , the crowd highway and complicate road traffic cause people to have greater expectation in the development of the subway .
i have to applaud the continuous increase in the effort in subway construction of beijing in all these year when i talk about subway development .
in july 2001 , with the success in the bid to host the olympics , beijing subway line 13 also usher in the completion of the entire line and become the newest member of the beijing subway family .
meanwhile , in october 2007 , the closely watch subway line 5 go into operation . it become the new trunk that link southern and northern beijing and intersect with line 1 .
while beijing resident enjoy the modernization of subway line 5 , in july 2008 , the first phase of construction of subway line 10 and in september 2009 , subway line 4 and line 8 all became operational one after another . at the same time , all suburban district and county be all connect by the subway successively .
in about 10 year time , the beijing subway transform from an underground supplementary mean of transport that only have two line to a 15 @-@ line underground transportation network that cover almost the entire beijing from changping in the north to daxing in the south , mentougou in the west , and tongzhou district in the east .
such rapid development be almost unimaginable by anyone and unachievable by any country .
while 2012 be quickly approach , there be even the spectacular scene of four line open at the same time . it be veritably " put all firepower into operation "!
the rapid coverage of underground transportation have bring along prosperity to surround community of the subway . resident no long have to worry about which bus route to take when they go out .
more resident gladly choose to travel by subway . it be both convenient and cozy .
needless to say , the subway have bring about convenience to the travel and work of the resident . more commendable be that the convenient subway have allow more resident to give up their car and choose such green mean of transportation that be environmental friendly .
not only do a reduction in car on the road alleviate traffic pressure on the road ; it also reduce the pressure of air pollution so that more resident can cheer for the blue sky of beijing from their heart .
these be all contribution of the subway . yet , where do the contribution of the subway come from ? they be naturally from the rapid development of the subway in beijing within these 10 year .
the development of the subway be the same as the rapid global development of the city of beijing , it will become a permanent city symbol of beijing and a benefit project that earn the satisfaction of the resident and the respect of the world .
beijing force ma ying @-@ jeou to declare stand on unification , taiwan can no long turn back
it can be say that the election that cover five major city have stir up a storm in taiwan .
in the midst of all this commotion , james soong make a sudden appearance to come head to head with ma ying @-@ jeou in the election .
this make the already worry ma ying @-@ jeou even more anxious , but there be nothing he can do .
this be link to the earlier stand mainland china make regard military cooperation with taiwan . in addition , james soong have express clearly that his take part in the election be to tell ma ying @-@ jeou that he have work hard to get the 1992 consensus from mainland china and ma should not let everyone down .
regard the chaos in taiwan and the future ultimate unification of mainland china and taiwan , what else do we still need to face ? what else do we have to do ?
regard the " weathervane " of ma ying @-@ jeou 's stand , what other preparation should we make ?
james soong 's transfer of allegiance be to force the undecided ma ying @-@ jeou to declare his stand on the ultimate unification
soong 's transfer of allegiance be , in a certain sense , a kind of response to mainland china 's intention .
on the issue of mainland china and taiwan , ma ying @-@ jeou have get a lot of room for maneuvering ,
from play the taiwan independence card for the sake of the election to play the card of attack mainland china and achieve military balance for the sake of the election . however , on the issue of the ultimate unification of mainland china and taiwan , not only do ma ying @-@ jeou fail to make any progress , he even take a big step backward .
in the past , he be stand close to the middle . now , he be start to gradually follow the footstep of the dpp . he keep push the bottom line of mainland china for the mere sake of manipulate the election . furthermore , he completely ignore the compromise make by mainland china and the effort it have put in for peaceful unification .
to save the taiwanese economy , mainland china have make huge policy adjustment such as absorb taiwan 's excess industrial capacity , buy taiwan 's excess agricultural product , give several taiwanese political figure room for international affair to carry out international affair , etc.
however , after all this wait , in the end it have to face ma ying @-@ jeou'a a double @-@ head snake that be seemingly false and real at the same time .
therefore , face this undecided ma ying @-@ jeou , james soong step up to defend mainland china !
be n't ma ying @-@ jeou want to score more point for his selection ? be n't he want to elevate his position through manipulate the people ?
the moment james soong appear , the situation change ! this be to force ma ying @-@ jeou to stop manipulate the election and declare his stand on the ultimate unification of mainland china and taiwan !
ma ying @-@ jeou be not mainland china 's only choice , but mainland china be go to be ma ying @-@ jeou 's only choice
so , what card be old ma leave with to play ?
military purchase - fetus die in the womb ;
economic development - eclipse by the prosperity of mainland china ;
culture - fully integrate with mainland china as well ;
as for military affair - taiwanese soldier , whether ex @-@ service or in service , be all under the control of mainland china 's military department .
as for the key taiwanese figure who hold military power , mainland china have long ago convince them with reason .
fellow countryman should not slaughter one another , and brother should not turn against one another - this make the taiwanese military less hostile towards mainland china .
as for the withdrawal of missile propose by ma ying @-@ jeou , it be also no longer an issue now .
so what be ma ying @-@ jeou still wait for ? for a major change to take place in taiwan ?
to mainland china , ma ying @-@ jeou be no long mainland china 's only choice .
mainland china be actively seek all force in taiwan that can be seek . even the dpp be start to change its course .
however , ma ying @-@ jeou , who be hold on and keep his mouth tight , have no other choice except mainland china , in other word , mainland china be ma ying @-@ jeou 's only choice .
basically , all the big boss of the kuomintang have visit mainland china and even receive vip treatment , get all the respect they deserve .
so , be ma ying @-@ jeou think about his future position or the great cause of the national unification ?
ma ying @-@ jeou might offend some people in taiwan who be eager to achieve taiwan independence , but ma ying @-@ jeou can gain the respect of the entire chinese population of 1.4 billion . compare the two , it should be clear which be important and which be not .
when nixon visit china back then , he turn the sino @-@ american relationship around . so , do n't ma ying @-@ jeou want his name to go down in history ?
could it be that be the bill of a chicken be really better than be the anus of an ox ?
hence , ma ying @-@ jeou should understand that he be only one of the choice of mainland china . it be up to him whether he want to achieve success and acquire fame .
watch out for ma ying @-@ jeou 's continue military resistance against unification by the lease @-@ to @-@ own method
though the unite state have recently increase its military presence in the asia pacific region , it be show a rare undecided stand on the taiwan issue .
the unite state be no long able to tell where taiwan be head , because all taiwanese senior politician be talk about unification and there be less and less talk about secession .
furthermore , a certain tacit agreement between mainland china and taiwan regard the diaoyu island have make the unite state feel somewhat unable to do what it want to do .
however , some people from the unite state and taiwan be still somewhat intelligent .
they no longer talk about military purchase but start propose a lease @-@ to @-@ own method for taiwan to get weapon .
the weapon taiwan have now be old .
the lease @-@ to @-@ own method might bring some advantage in conduct cut @-@ edge military confrontation with mainland china , but fundamentally speak , taiwan no long have the strength to fight against mainland china .
if it continue to take its old path of resist unification through military force , then it will meet a very tragic end !
diaoyu island will be a touchstone - taiwan can no long turn back
of course , there be still many opportunity for mainland china and taiwan . for example , the diaoyu island be the first touchstone of cooperation between mainland china and taiwan .
when it come to the diaoyu island , mainland china and taiwan can jointly deploy naval vessel , jointly defend the diaoyu island , and join hand in fight japan .
recently , within taiwan , active action have be take concern the ownership of taiwan as well .
for example , there have be active change as to how the japan issue be treat , how the historical issue of the resistance war be treat , and how the issue of taiwan as part of mainland china in the past be treat .
it be these change that make the entire taiwan , from top to bottom , reach a consensus that it can survive by stay close to mainland china .
face mainland china 's offensive effort towards unification , taiwan can no long turn back .
taiwan will become another traitor if it go into japan 's embrace . only by go into mainland china 's embrace will taiwan have a bright future !
in short , james soong be merely someone through whom mainland china 's stance range from active cooperation to slight warn be demonstrate .
if ma ying @-@ jeou do not want to oversleep after go back to bed in the morning , he must truly face what the people of both side of the strait have be hope for for a century !
it be up to him whether he want to be a sinner of the nation or a meritorious contributor to the nation !
when that time come , the people of mainland china will respond enthusiastically to ma ying @-@ jeou !
what 's go on !
damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . why be they come out ?

a letter from the victim 's family
first of all , i would like to thank a kind @-@ hearted person for call the police immediately . i would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrator .
early in the morning on september 1 , my father , as usual , be ride his bicycle to gucheng park for exercise . at jiuli street , he see someone lie on the side of the road , and so , out of kindness , he go up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon . then , three people run up to him , kick and beaing him ( accord to the police , they have drunk four case of beer at the time ) . as a result , my father 's skull suffer serious injury . he bleed profusely and lose consciousness . by the time he be take to the hospital , his pupil be already dilate . however , with prompt rescue give by a doctor , he survive . as there be serious bleed , the doctor perform a life @-@ save surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father 's head to remove blood clot . due to profuse bleed , some of the blood have already flow into the brainstem and bottom of the brain , put his life in danger .
right now , my father be in very serious condition . on september 1 , he undergo a 5 @-@ hour craniotomy . on september 2 , he have a tracheotomy and a respirator be use to help him breathe . currently , he be still unconscious . after these few day of hospital treatment , he be sometimes able to move his arm and foot , and he be show sign of recovery .
as his children , we feel very terrible now . it have be six day since the incident . under the police 's advice , the perpetrator finally give 10,000 yuan . we have already deliver the money to the hospital . now , almost 50,000 yuan have be spend on the medical bill . we do n't know when we can get money to pay for future medical bill .

tragedy

nowadays , to be a good person be really not something you can do casually . hope the perpetrator can assume the responsibility
sentence all of them to life imprisonment and let 's see if they be go to pay
poor old man . he 's still stick in the era of learn from lei feng . the society today be a mess .
it 's tough to be a good person !
it 's tough to be a good person !
punish severely ! it look like we have to mind our own business !
it be legal as long as three hour of sunshine can be achieve .
most high @-@ rise building with a space of 100 meter can certainly achieve that .
three hour of sunshine , from morning till night , can certainly be achieve .
most sunlight issue raise by the elderly men and women be indeed not against the national requirement , so they 're merely unreasonable complaint of the elderly as a result of their perceive discomfort .
even if there be a court judgment confirm that the developer be not against the law , they will still persist with their unreasonable demand .
reply to light @-@ and @-@ shadow @-@ hero on the 10 th floor :
three hour of sunshine be a technical term . sunlight analysis be need . setback of space be relate to not only the sunshine space but also the floor thickness . a sunshine space coefficient of 1 @:@ 1.4 can meet the requirement for three hour of sunshine on the day of great cold in taizhou . all we want be that the developer do the job legally , and make it clear that sunshine analysis have show that the minimum national requirement can be meet !
but what you say be also somewhat reasonable . the minimum standard be not acceptable to most people . they have a good reason to ask for more sunlight . however , this developer be too strong . we just want to secure the minimum legitimate interest accord to the national regulation , but even that be so difficult for us !
guanxi and operation , alas .
i remain poise
china : there be too many issue now ! be that because good official be too few ?
developer always want to make more money . we have a build here , which have not be pull down so far even after expose by cctv . how powerful the developer be .
the follow be a quotation of all owner of pengxinlidu build no. 14 's word on the 1 st floor :
all netizens and media be welcome to look into this matter . let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the official in general secretary hu 's hometown when deal with matter concern a big developer ! ...
uh ... do you have legislative power or enforcement power ?

victim 's son
latest development
victim : old mr. yang be currently still unconscious and in critical condition .
the family member of old mr. yang say tearfully that when the old man be be send to the hospital , his pupil be already dilate . he have be transfer to icu ( intensive care unit ) after receive emergency treatment give by the hospital .
the medical cost alone add up to as much as more than 5,000 yuan a day .
perpetrator : three men have be criminally detain by zhenjiang jingkou police .
after the three of them pay 10,000 yuan in total for the medical cost ,
the family of ma recently again raise 10,000 yuan to pay for surgery .
hereby , we hope the perpetrator will be able to show resolution in take on responsibility and face seriously the mistake that have be commit .
victim 's family : as old mr. yang be still in a toxic and unconscious state , he be unable to provide information about what happen at the time of the incident .
though the three perpetrator have pay 10,000 yuan compensation in total , it be obviously not enough to pay for the current medical cost that be increase sharply by the day .
furthermore , in view of the criminal detention time limit , can such punishment have a deterrent effect on the perpetrator ?
how about future medical cost ?
the yang family hope to get legal and media assistance .
associate incident
the moment this incident come out , this writer could not help but recall the " touch porcelain " case that happen two year ago !
case like the one where " a vehicle owner who help an old lady lie on the ground get up be accuse of knock her down " all raise a huge uproar across town .
sometimes , i even doubt the frequency at which such incident happen , life be get to really look like fiction !
the society always make you feel painfully scare . every day , there always seem to be countless reason that make people curse .
let 's not say much . let 's pray for the injure and hope the perpetrator get punish .
the perpetrator be not go to be hold responsible just because they say they be poor ! ?
who dare to be a samaritan in future ?
the important thing be to save life !
are there any solution ? provide legal assistance !
let the law show its might~
it take 30 day before public prosecution be initiate . even day lily wither by then ! ~
this be actually not about be a samaritan or not . many drunkard have lose their consciousness and will get in a drunken fit .
when you want to help , you have to see who it be . if you can n't handle , just call 120. sigh ...
severe punishment still should be give to those who commit crime after drink . if not , it will be chaos if everyone pretend to be drunk and bash up others .
nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either
such a cup .
the old man be look for trouble . he should have keep a distance after see those drunkard .
would everyone agree with illegal construction of high @-@ rise building ?
now , in the hometown of our beloved general secretary hu , such a strange thing be happen .
here be the thing : shenzhen maoye developer have come to hail district , taizhou city , jiangsu province for urban construction , and be welcome by our people .
we do not oppose the construction of high @-@ rise building . however , the developer be go to construct a high @-@ rise build against the law . that be what we be resolutely oppose to !
maoye developer have plan a high @-@ rise build of 150 m in the julangchao lot of the old east station , hail district , taizhou city .
julangchao use to be the eastern suburb park , for which many of the old taizhou people have great affection .
pengxinlidu build no. 14 be just locate at the back of the julangchao lot , and now pengxinlidu build no. 14 be only about 100 meter from the external wall of the original building at the farthest end of the julangchao lot .
how do the developer meet the national requirement for build setback based on a minimum sunshine space of 1 @:@ 1.4 in taizhou ?
aside from the other sunshine shelter , how can the developer ensure a minimum three hour of sunshine on the day of great cold ?
it be certainly not feasible if they want to cheat about the 3 hour technically ,
the plain fact be just in front of us . moreover , be those few entity the only one capable of do sunshine analysis in china ?
we certainly will verify it . a lie will never become the truth !
if the developer can not even give us owner a minimum of three hour on the day of great cold in accordance with the national requirement , which have ensure its best interest , how can it give a reasonable and fair explanation to the society , the vast community of netizens and the mass ?
where be the conscience and moral of the developer ?
we understand that the developer want to get more benefit , but those be suppose to be legitimate benefit !
on the one hand , such act , if illegally infringe upon other people 's interest , will be detrimental to the reputation and long @-@ term future development of the entire maoye group . on the other hand , be people whose interest be infringe all fool ?
will they just let the infringement occur ?
the minimum 3 hour be already difficult to accept . if it be basically an illegal act that make the fundamental three hour even less , think about it - how will thing evolve ?
finally , the contradiction be bind to intensify , make the situation out of hand .
we hope that the developer can seriously think about this issue , avoid loss and seek its own legal interest through rational development and reasonable development accord to law !
if the developer be determine to infringe on our right and interest , we will surely unite as one to defend our legitimate right and interest !
the most strange thing be that some people of high rank even agree with the illegal construction of high @-@ rise building . we hereby earnestly request the people of high rank who agree with the illegal construction of high @-@ rise building to raise their hand and give us a way out !
all netizens and media be welcome to look into this matter . let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the official in general secretary hu 's hometown when deal with matter concern a big developer !
all netizens be welcome to look into this matter !
hello , everyone !
previously , due to issue about the high @-@ rise building on maoye 's pre @-@ sale rendering and eia by the taizhou municipal environmental protection bureau , the young and old of pengxinlidu build no. 14 be neither sleep nor eat well . some be depress , and some be irritate . in short , we feel very angry .
now taizhou municipal plan bureau have give us a clear answer that those be simply rendering . upon verification , the plan bureau have request the developer to make modification . the bureau will definitely exercise administration accord to law , and never approve anything unless it be legal , reasonable and fair ! a forum and a hear will also be hold prior to approval ! a large stone in our heart have finally drop onto the ground .
we be move that in the face of such a huge benefit , our leader of taizhou municipal government and taizhou municipal plan bureau have stood unswayed , show a very noble sentiment and reflect the characteristic of the communist in serve the people , which be truly admirable !
all owner of pengxinlidu build no. 14 hereby express deep respect and gratitude to taizhou municipal government and taizhou municipal plan bureau for uphold justice ! people live in taizhou be happy , thank to the official care for them like their parent !
we thank the government for its concern over people ! we strongly support for the government administration accord to law !
all owner , pengxinlidu build no.14

i hope that the developer do not come to compete against us for sunlight . how do we live without sunlight ?
all netizens and media be welcome to look into this matter . let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the official in general secretary hu 's hometown when deal with matter concern a big developer ! for us ordinary people who be like dog shit in this society , it be ridiculous to discuss whether power or law be superior .
i feel really good about that oh oh
what 's the point of law over power ?
it be the powerful that make the final execution .
yeah , in the real world , we vulnerable group really feel at a loss as to what to do so often . the power of developer be too great ,
some relevant government department just blatantly give the green light to developer against the law and help them fool people !
so we have to frequently ask ourselves : be the law enact by this country really useful ?
be it really capable of restrain developer from grab through deceit or by force and illegally obtain benefit ?
but we can not just watch as the developer take away our sunlight , leave children and the elderly shiver at home in cold winter . if so , we can n't live a healthy life , nor can we enjoy the warmth of the sun !
japan have be think about invade china for a long time . would it need the assignment from russia to decide whether to invade china or not ? not to mention that the us only act against the political system of china ? was it still not enough for russia to be fool after 1991?
the weapon market in south asia have be dominate by the hairy country . though it be weaken by the us weapon market , however , the russian weapon market still occupy the major portion .
it be not russia deliberately make use of country on the south china sea to besiege china .
look at the chaos in the east china sea and the south china sea , even think with your ass , you will also know that it be the us rather than russia try to cause trouble .
firstly , russia be not a country with sea power . it have no interest in intervene and meddle in the issue of the east and south china sea .
secondly , at present , with the expansion and extrusion of nato , russia can hardly protect its own traditional zone of influence . we can say it be busy enough with its own affair .
and presently , the asia @-@ pacific military cooperation and nato be all product of the us 's two @-@ ocean strategy .
after world war i , two system have take place . one be the versailles system in europe and the atlantic , and the other be the us @-@ japanese washington system in the far east and the pacific .
the us stretch over the two ocean , and control the two system at the same time .
after world war ii , it take control of the two system respectively , castrate germany in europe , and japan stay alone in asia to be hermaphrodite , live on by help the us manufacture electronics and automobile product .
and now , the biggest enemy for the us be such large geopolitical power in the old world as russia and china .
while russia and the west have no so @-@ call estrangement in ideology and political system , nato still continue to expand to the east .
and now the asia @-@ pacific military cooperation be set up a blockage line and a ring of encirclement around the coastal region in east and south china .
the coup in central asia have not succeed . otherwise , once the ring of encirclement be complete , the northern land will cause a headache to you just as the east china sea and the south china sea .
do you still believe that china can become a friend of the us as long as it change its ideology and system ?
the reason for china to ally with russia be that both russia and china need to heal their wound from after the disintegration of the soviet union and with the savage hegemony of the us .
solve the exist territorial dispute be an important mean of realize mutual trust . of course china have make great concession . there be no other choice .
in fact , unlike china , russia have neither the policy of reform of open up nor a good future ( this precious opportunity be seize by china at the historical turn point then , while in russia , it be ruin by the two idiot at the critical moment . it also show that the russians be relatively inferior to the chinese people in term of both iq and eq ) .
the russians be bare @-@ foot , so they be not afraid of a china with shoe .
china have enough reason to make concession to russia . china have no fear . china have many opportunity and china have other approach .
although russia be not our friend , we should not turn it into an enemy .
russia and japan should not be equate with each other .
to the chinese people , if russia wantonly kill chinese people in china 's traditional area of activity like japan do , then in the sentiment of ordinary chinese people , they would hate russia as much as they hate japan . however , they do not .
the only case where they wantonly kill chinese people happen at the end of the tsing dynasty . it be the disputable hailanpao slaughter .
thousand or ten of thousand , the number be just a small proportion even compare with the population of the manchu .
it can even be ignore if compare with the chinese population of nearly 400 million . can it be equate with japan 's massacre of chinese people in the populate north and southeast of china ?
besides , russia be a european country with its strategic focus in the west . the far east be never its focus .
if the russians really want to seriously take china as their arch enemy , they should strive to construct the far east .
however , nowadays , with its own serious problem , it continue to abandon the far east and many city have become heap of ruin .
it show that russia 's strategic focus have be in the west , address the expansion of nato . only traitor will be advocate hostile relation between china and russia here .
the us can pose a greater threat and impact upon china than russia , especially in the core area of china .
the reason be simple . russia be a european country . the far east be not its focus , while the us be a country in the asia @-@ pacific region .
do you know the theory of sea control ? nowadays , be there more influence from the us or russia in the issue of the taiwan strait and the south china sea and the far east ? it be the us ! this be clear proof !
do you think that territorial water be n't territory ? in modern time , the strategic and economic value of territorial water be much more than those of land territory . one can only become a strong power and have a say in the international community by control the sea .
why be it not china , its neighbor , but instead great britain , separate by vast ocean , that make india into a colony ?
nowadays , russia have serious problem itself . its armament be quite obsolete , and the live condition for its people be extremely adverse . the population have face a sharp reduction .
the national elite all know the home country be hopeless , so they all run abroad .
it have become common practice for women to marry foreigner , and many of them come to china and become prostitute .
even the productivity of the population be seriously lack . it be impossible for it to constitute a threat to china .
and nowadays the us be besiege and contain china openly with a view of disrupt china .
why leave the current problem unsolved , but seize on russia , which have no ability to pose a threat to china at present ?
when it come to that russia occupy china 's territory , that be another story like the japanese do . japan want to invade the whole country of china , but can russia do that ?
russia be a european country with its strategic focus on the west , rather than the far east . its expansion to the far east in history be also partly non @-@ governmental and partly governmental .
japan be separate from china only by a strait , with the spacious pacific behind it . there be no menace from the rear if it invade china with all its strength . can russia do that ?
even if russia put a little bit more energy into the issue of china and the far east , can it ignore the affair in europe ?
moreover , we would rather say that russia have avail itself of opportunity , than to say that it have invade and occupy china 's territory .
at that time , those place be far away from china 's traditional live area . china 's exploration be a little bit later at that time . there have be few inhabitant around those place in history .
at that time , those place be bitterly cold place cover with waist @-@ deep snow . so we pay no heed to them .
although when it come to now , these place be of great economic and strategic importance . however , at that time we do n't discover that ; therefore , at that time even the ruler of china pay no heed to the place , and sent no immigrant there for quite a long time .
just like today 's ocean . from the perspective of today , they have huge economic value , so territorial water be also important territory .
however , in the past , they be not discover . and territorial water be not regard as territory . they even exercise trade prohibition on the sea area and close the coastline .
yet the russians avail themselves of a favorable geological location to occupy those place ahead of us . the russians be just avail themselves of opportunity .
at that time , it be a time when big power establish colony everywhere . unlike today , when the behavior of all country be bound by international law .
other big power have to capture colony by war . for example , it be through war that britain and japan occupy hong kong and taiwan respectively .
however , the russians get such a big place without much effort . that be because the ruler of china do n't care for the unexplored place .
they just avail themselves of opportunity . thing such as territory be hard to talk about .
if it be your imminent area of activity , it might be justifiable .
however , if it be a place that you do n't send immigrant to explore for a long period throughout history , and be take by others because of a favorable geographical location and convenient access , then as time go by it would be hard to say , after a certain length of time .
it would be barely passable for you to claim it to be yours . this be totally different from japan . can russia launch a barbaric war of aggression to occupy china 's imminent territory like japan do ?
can it provoke * to invade northeast china and launch an all @-@ out war of aggression against china because northeast china have become an imminent territory of china like northern china with the arrival and exploration of large number of immigrant from inside shanhaiguan pass ? it be impossible .
the opinion of the writer wuhan tuo la ji shou on the upper floor be brilliant ! however , by reverse the order of " subjugation of the nation " and " elimination of the entire race , " would it be in line with the historical fact ?
right now russia be clamoring " to build india into the top military power in asia." putin personally seal the arm sale deal to sell india advance weapon such as aircraft carrier , nuclear @-@ power submarine , t50 fighter and brahmos missile ... even the weapon it sell to vietnam be more advanced than those it sell to china . and it only sell china big airplane and carrier aircraft . its wild ambition be thoroughly expose !
it be a pity that the present dynasty be national scum support by the soviet union ! while the yellow russians be prevail , what else can the grass @-@ root folk do ?
it seem that all chinese hate japanese , and i be not an exception . however , have everybody think it over that it be russia who stir up the war between china and japan for fear that china would reclaim territory from it ? it be also russia that went between the communist party and the kmt and be able to achieve success one way or the other . and at the end of the war of resistance , it then stir up the civil war , and lure china to get involve in the korean war . if stalin be still alive , china would have more trouble !
even if it have prop up an agent in china , it be still concern about china . and in the 21 st century , it continue to play little trick of provoke anti @-@ chinese sentiment . it sell weapon to vietnam and check and seize the cargos of chinese merchant . its crime be so numerous that bamboo strip would be exhaust before they could all be record .
what be regretful be that our government deal with such kind of thing in different way . if the us or japan do so , mr. qin gang and ms. jiangyu would absolutely deliver a so @-@ call just and severe statement of condemnation . yet with regard to the incident of the chinese boatmen who be shoot by russia , there be not even a protest present . and it become an incident with no definite result in the year 2009 .
the greatest threat of subjugation of the nation come from russia . in history , country be eliminate by this nation be as many as the star in the sky . moreover , in the history of china , almost all geographical threat come from the north .
the greatest threat of " elimination of the entire race " come from japan . the seed of national hatred be indelible . once discharge accidentally , it would not be just territorial conflict , but a massacre .
the greatest threat of downfall of d come from the us . the dramatic contrast of ideology cause the us to treat all dictate ds in the world as target to be remove .
however , there be no need to worry that he would have any claim for territory .
the greatest threat to the economy come from the eu . the eu frequently take the opportunity of trade or human right conflict between china and the us to grab a large portion of the market , and squeeze the surplus value . now it have become our biggest trade partner .
personally i think the geopolitical environment of china be quite adverse . however , just as what the floor host say , the real threat come from russia .

do you think nowadays that russia still have the capacity to do that ?
if the communist party of china do not put the practical interest of the people first , but continue to tolerate the corrupt government , the people would lose their faith in the party , and in the near future it could hardly be avoid that the territory of china would be divide by an alliance of the us and russia !
it be foreseeable that they have put their hand into our neighboring country , and they have instigate pressure on our country from all side . has n't the government in power run by the communist party been claim to be strong ? and now it be time for you to bring your wisdom into play~
the sino @-@ japanese war and the civil war of china be stir up by russia , and russia have the ability to force china to send troop to north korea ? nonsense !
for china , china and unite state have the biggest relationship in the world , and the sino @-@ us relationship be a trade @-@ off relationship .
in the most recent visit to the us by xi jinping , which be an exercise before he become the top official in china , the primary topic discuss be mutually beneficial economic cooperation of the two side .
the sino @-@ us relationship be very complicate . economically , the two side be partner on unequal footings ,
politically , it be a relationship between socialism and capitalism ; militarily , chinese and us militaries be in an isolated state .
therefore , currently china be play game with the unite state , i.e. how to offset the latter two relationship with economic cooperation .
next be a brief analysis of the main strategy of xi jinping 's visit to the us :
first , what be the biggest puzzle between china and the us ?
the biggest puzzle in front of china be how to maintain its relationship with the us as it become increasingly powerful .
to china , it cannot fall out with the us .
if china fall out with the us , then it will seriously consume china 's strength and will be very unfavorable for future development of china ,
because china will lose the situation of peaceful development internationally , such that china have to cope with not only the powerful military threat pose by the us , but also complicate relation in the neighboring area . this will seriously consume china energy for development .
therefore , on the premise of not fall out with the us , china , on the one hand , still have to maintain relationship with the us , while on the other hand , it have to precaution against the dirty trick that the us play on china .
second , it be not time yet to be tough to the us .
some believe that china should be tough to the us . be the us someone that yield to hawkishness ?
in the soviet union era , it get in a race for hegemony against the us , where both side be so tough that they become enemy , which provide the us the opportunity to break up thoroughly with the soviet union .
as the us do not need the ussr to exist as a great power , the us could attack the ussr and tackle the ussr without any hesitation .
the road china be go along at present be one where the two side be intertwine with each other , such that the us also suffer great loss when attack and impose sanction on china .
what 's more , many businesspeople in the us also come out to oppose the government 's behaviors . china will be able to truly rise as long as it can keep on for ten year .
as the ancient say go , a gentleman can afford to wait for as long as ten year to avenge . if china fall out with the us too early , it will put itself in a very disadvantaged position .
although we be strong today , it 's not time yet to fight the final battle with the us .
third , the two phase that the sino @-@ us relationship will go through .
it be not advisable to fight a major war in the china 's dealing with the us .
the author believe the two side could only undergo two phase . the first one be a period which see china grow in strength and the us feel seriously threaten .
the second stage be when china have become strong , the us be no long certain about win a war with china , such that it have no choice than to cooperate in order to obtain more benefit .
to avoid war between china and the us , it appear extremely important to carry out exchange between the two people .
next let 's have a look at survey result of americans view towards china :
an opinion poll of a us website show that 6 % of the people believe china and the us be " ally , " 69 % think they be " friendly but not ally , " and 4 % believe they be " enemy ."
survey result also show that 71 % of the americans believe sino @-@ us relation be " very important or somewhat important , " while the proportion be 85 % in opinion leader .
on the 14 th , the washington post say that in an opinion poll it conduct jointly with the american broadcast company , 52 % of the respondent see china in a negative way .
this result reflect two urgent issue . first , china be not that bad in the mind of american people , and there be still environment and scope to continue expand exchange .
second , if china and the us do not handle their relation properly , lack in communication between its people and the foundation or friendship , then the chinese and american people may turn hostile .
therefore , the chinese and american people must enhance cooperation and bring the two side closer through economic cooperation , so as to offset the discrepancy bring by military and politics .
however , it be undeniable that serious conflict remain between china and the us in some important area .
for instance : the taiwan issue ; human right and democracy ; north korea ; iran ; proliferation of weapon of mass destruction ; pakistan ; geopolitics and military strategy ; trade and currency ; intellectual property right and internet spy .
these puzzle cannot be overcome with the two character of friendship alone . after all it involve major interest .
so it be no secret to the two side . just like vice president xi jinping count on the us to oppose taiwan independence and tibetan , how could china count on a geopolitical enemy ?
national president be all master in politics , who know what 's at stake . however , what should be say should be say . the thing be if the us have say something , it will break its word if it do n't do what it say , which will show to people in the world that the us be immoral and its word do n't count .
anyway , between china and the us in the future , whoever be a better strategist and whoever come up with more sophisticated strategy win .
it require wisdom to be friend with an enemy . you can only fight a hundred war without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
this view tell us a fact that one will earn respect by develop military force
the cannon be thick
it require wisdom to be friend with an enemy . you can only fight a hundred war without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
chairman mao have say a long time ago : one will be beat if he @/@ she be backward . only development be of override importance !

it be fun ? they be order the dog they fee at home to bark at you , yet you have go to shake hand with them , look for slap
brainwash the chinese people on behalf of the americans .
brainwash the chinese people on behalf of the americans .
be it the american system that 's superior or the chinese system that 's superior after all ?
i think taiwan and the mainland be already distinguish relative superiority or inferiority between them . the thread starter should take a look outside the country more
you look but not see the zg 's chaos in society , or be it voluntary blindness !
i also feel that there be more modern " traitor of china " than during wwii .
everyone have eye , look at the live situation of north korea and south korea - do you still not understand ?
venture exchange ,
if i take care of myself , that 's good enough , when the country need me , i 'll be compel by my sense of righteousness
if these traitor of china exist around 50 , 60 year ago , they would already have be execute by fire squad .
to make a conclusion , you must have something to demonstrate it
i do n't have time to go search
i wish lz would explain them one by one ...
their property and family be all outside of the country , of course they will , just like the official .
when the country need me , i 'll be compel by my sense of righteousness
i can just take a look , and dare not to speak my mind , the police can grab people , thread starter , i admire you for dare to speak ! bump !
the rule authority actually should pay attention to these kind of capitulators and traitor of china !
comrade deng xiaoping once say that the communist party will not be overthrow - if it fall , it will be bring down from within the party itself .
former us ambassador to china mr. huntsman once say in a speech in the us : we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in china , let the chinese themselves topple china -
and the cia then use an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so @-@ call elite , vow that they want to let them raise the wind to make wave domestically , citizen definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsider use us .
in the summer of 2005 , a picture that people have long be look forward to start emerge with frequency in various major hong kong media .
with their unique charm , these well - know cartoon image once again cause hong kong to be a focus of worldwide attention .
the world 's fifth disney park will soon open to the public here .
the most important thing about disney be that it be a global brand .
well , for several year , although it be still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be say that many people have view hong kong with new respect .
then welcome to the official write ceremony of hong kong disneyland .
the construction of hong kong disneyland begin two year ago , in 2003 .
in january of that year , the hong kong government turn over to disney corporation 200 hectare of land at the foot of lantau island that be obtain follow the largest land reclamation project in recent year .
one .
since then , this area have become a prohibit zone in hong kong .
as its neighbor on lantau island , hong kong international airport have to change its flight route to make this area a no - fly zone .
mickey mouse 's new home , settle on chinese land for the first time , have capture worldwide attention .
there 's only one month left before the open of hong kong disneyland on september 12 .
the subway to disney have already be construct .
at subway station , passenger will frequently press the station for disney on ticket machine , try to purchase ticket to enjoy the park when it first open .
meanwhile , the disney subway station be schedule to open on the same day as the park .
for two year , disney have constantly maintain its mystery .
no media have be allow to enter for photo .
we take a taxi along the path of the highway that head toward disney , try to experience this mysterious park from close by .
however , before any of the disney symbol be in sight , the car be stop by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards disney .
on our way back , the taxi driver give us an explanation after understand our intention .
er , accord to what the security guard say , for the time before everything be officially open , open , all , no car can enter unless they have special permission .
no one can enter otherwise .
video record be especially forbid .
ah , everything be top secret .
if picture be take without permission , %pw that be to say , it will at all time be pursue by legal action , a big hassle .
although disney corporation choose hong kong as the venue for the chinese disney park , what they be actually most excite about be the mainland china tourist market .
since the implementation of the individual visit scheme between hong kong and the mainland , more and more mainland tourist be come to visit hong kong .
from the begin up till now , more than seven million individual tourist have , have come to hong kong .
well , we now , er , believe more will be come .
at this point , it have be about two year .
also , the current number of 34 city will be increase .
hong kong be develop from a fish harbor one hundred year ago to become today 's international metropolis .
here , eastern and western culture have gather , and the new and the old coexist .
when in hong kong , you can wander among skyscraper , heartily enjoy shop spree in well - know store and mall for goods from various country , and taste delicious snack from all over the world at tea shop or at street stand in mong kok .

or hop onto a trolley with over a century of history , and feel the city 's blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .
after dark , cruise victoria harbor at night to enjoy the enchant even view .
every corner of hong kong be fill with fun .
meanwhile , as various new item be constantly be add , what other kind of pleasant surprise will the hong kong tourism industry bring us ?
over the past 28 year , the ocean park have basically be a must - see destination for tourist come to hong kong .
watch spectacular performance by dolphin and sea lion at the ocean theater , and experience passionate scream and accelerate heart - beat adventure on amusement ride .
or ride the giant ferris wheel to get a bird 's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of hong kong island and the south china sea .
these item , which be the pride of the ocean park , have make this place the most popular tourist attraction in hong kong for some time .
however , since disney enter hong kong , the ocean park , share the same city as disney , have feel the pressure of competition .
to improve the park 's brand , they be plan to invest 5.5 billion in a renovation project start in 2006 .
it seem that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .
that be , the entire park will be divide into seven section for renovation .
ah , additional , new , ah , attraction will be available for tourist .
it seem that those attraction like the north pole and the marine life center will also be renovate after several year .
are they go to be different from what they be now ?
they will be , in ten year .
ah , there will be more animal , and more animal species , different from what there be now .
it look like we will also bring in whale .
er , we will implement this plan as soon as it be approve by the government .
groundbreaking be expect to start next year .
yes .
the area of hong kong be only one thousand - plus square kilometers .
the population be dense .
natural resource be relatively scarce .
however , the clever hong kong people will utilize all resource they have create for develop the hong kong tourism industry .
among these be the avenue of star .
enter hollywood of the east ,
here , you can come up close with the star in your mind .
he be my .
she be my goddess , ah .
please stay with us on new world travel .
hong kong have always wear the crown of hollywood of the east .
over the past 100 year of film history , hong kong cinema have nurture many internationally renowned director , actor , and screenwriters .
they have shorten the distance between hong kong and the world .
hong kong movie have even become a window for the world to see hong kong , which have make the image of metropolitan hong kong more prominent internationally .
for this reason , in 2004 , on the waterfront promenade originally construct for view only the scenery of hong kong island and victoria harbor , the hong kong tourism board also construct the avenue of star , memorialize hong kong 's 100 - year film history .
here , tourist can learn about hong kong 's film history , and can come up close with the star in their mind .
hong kong be a busy metropolis .
even at dusk , the city 's pulse never stop beat .
across from the avenue of star , a special performance be stage every weekend .
%pw as our victoria harbor be %pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape be already very beautiful , by what mean could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?
so , one idea be to transform victoria harbor into a performance stage .
er , each key build be like a performer .
it be based on this that music and light be arrange to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinate multi @-@ media world - class light show .
let me now introduce to you all the well - know skyscraper participate in this large - scale light and music show .
the pla hong kong garrison plaza , bank of china tower , at 8 @:@ 00 every saturday night , hsbc main build .
their performance will be on schedule .
center of the east central .
ten landmark building locate on hong kong island reveal themselves one by one , participate in the show in full splendor , present a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .
whenever there be a major event or holiday , firework be also add to the light show .
some , er , city have consult with us .
uh @-@ huh .
their area of surprise be that those private , er , building , that be , the business community , ah , be willing to invest in our overall project .
yes .
the answer be that this be a reward to the entire society , not an individual build 's reward .
er , of course , after sars , we feel that all of hong kong hope to be involve , so that the hong kong tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sector .
hong kong wetland park , which be currently under construction , be also one of the designate new project of the hong kong sar government for advance the hong kong tourism industry .
this be a park intimately connect with nature , be build by the hong kong government for its people who live in a city of reinforce concrete .
hong kong wetland park cover an area of 61 hectare , include a 10,000 square meter visitor 's center and a 60 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .
in the indoor exhibition hall , tourist can learn about type of wetlands in various part of the world , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .
outdoors , they can also personally experience wetland ecology .
at the highest point of hong kong , er , from the highest point we can see two different ecological environment .
ha , on that side be many tall building , that be , town with lot of people live there ,
but behind me be our wetland park .
ha , entirely different .
quite primitive ,
er , a fresh water swamp ,
er , the wetland park exploration center .
lastly , far away you can see putian of shenzhen .
then , the bridge be , on the bridge be hong kong and outside be shenzhen .
you can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .
children can get to know different animal and plant , and even some crop that be rarely see in our daily life .
over here be paddy field , which be rather unique .
ha , there be aquatic plant inside .
ah , the most special be rice , because %pw many hong kong children nowadays have never see what rice look like .
look over there .
they be go to be ripe soon .
the long one over there .
oh .
yes .
with , with ear , ah .
where ?
ah , here .
perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the name of the crop when they see them .
let , let them get some understand .
mai po marsh adjacent to wetland park be a major wildlife habitat within asia .
each year , over 50,000 migratory bird fly over hong kong 's skyscraper and choose to roost for winter here .
as a result , three different type of aviary be build in hong kong wetland park .
these have become the best spot to observe bird .
among common bird , a rather special one be the black - face spoonbill .
it be an endanger bird species throughout the world .
uh @-@ huh .
ah , there be only about 1,500 in the world .
wow .
um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of them come to hong kong to spend the winter .
some of them , er , have stay in hong kong wetland park .
uh @-@ huh .
so , our park 's logo be unique , feature this black - face spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people 's attention .
uh @-@ huh .
wetland park worker be now in the middle of intensive work .
they will complete the park 's entire construction by the begin of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 discover hong kong year campaign .
ah , we have establish the year 2006 as discover hong kong year .
why be that ?
because , as everyone know , our disneyland will open in september of this year .
in addition , we will have ngong ping 360 , that be , the cable car , er , to the giant buddha .
they add to what we already have , like the avenue of star , which be also very famous .
moreover , er , we be include our software .
hong kong 's software be very well know .
like what 's use in our symphony of light .
we hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 discover hong kong year .
without plan it in advance , they choose to settle here .
a dream that have be anticipate for more than twenty year will soon come true here .
because your line connect us with two --
in recent year , hong kong 's tourist attraction have gradually move from hong kong island to kowloon and the new territory .
two out of the four new attraction participate in the 2006 discover hong kong year be locate on lantau island of the new territory .
for this reason , lantau island have become a new hong kong tourism popular spot .
the earliest to settle here be this world 's largest outdoor seat bronze buddha .
in chinese buddhism , there be five direction - east , west , south , north , and center - and five buddhas .
therefore , hong kong 's tian tan giant buddha at the most southern tip of china , together with lingshan giant buddha in the east , leshan giant buddha in the west , yungang giant buddha in the north , and longmen giant buddha in the central plain , exist as the representative buddhas for each of the five direction of china .
as a result , this place have become holy land in the heart of male and female devotee .
however , to common tourist , more of what this place bring them be wonder and awe .
since this giant bronze buddha settle on lantau island , the world renowned hong kong international airport at chek lap kok and disneyland have also be construct here in succession .
the important status of lantau island be increasingly apparent .
no , it be totally inaccessible in the past .
in the near future , construction will also begin on a cross @-@ sea bridge connect hong kong , zhuhai , and macao .
in 1992 --
could n't go in summer --
so , after their return , macao , and hong kong , the two special administrative region , be basically still use ship and helicopter to stay connect .
it 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .
one have to go up to shenzhen , dongguan , then go through panyu , keep go up , to zhongshan , and certainly go to zhuhai , then pass through zhuhai to get to macao .
for a hong kong person choose to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient .
a full twenty year ago , hopewell holding group chairman wu ying - sheung , a well - know construction tycoon , boldly make a cross @-@ sea bridge proposal .
with this bridge , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer .
however , due to various reason , bridge construction be put off .
this be what we have see since 1999 .
anticipate for 20 year , today this dream be finally come true .
well , originally the construction of the new --
with this new hong kong - zhuhai - macao bridge that basically lead to all three place , hong kong , macao , and zhuhai , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .
macao be this way , and zhuhai be this way .
from the perspective of either hong kong , macao , or zhuhai , our concept be a tourism zone .
er , %pw zhuhai for sightsee tour , macao for entertainment , and we have disneyland and other , other attraction in hong kong .
each place have different attraction of its own .
so , with this bridge , when some old friend , friend from mainland china or from foreign country come to our place , it seem they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several day , before , ha , go home .
once the zhuhai - hong kong - macao bridge be build , it will no longer be a dream of tourist to enjoy gourmet food in macao before have fun at disneyland just an hour later .
promotion of hong kong disneyland have long since begun .
however , even though it have enter the last countdown period before its final open , this wonderland be still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil .
ah , currently it have be decide that disney will open on september 12 .
there 's also what we call soft open .
ah , they be now rehearse .
ah , different , ah , some group , they be rehearse their service , well , hope that they will become use to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourist come in september .
well , i be very confident , that when our tourist come to disneyland , they will certainly return home very satisfy .
the wonder tour will start from hong kong .
this dynamic metropolis never cease its movement .
it continue to explore ; it continue to open new world .
each day , there be always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .
hong kong be a world famous shop paradise .
what determine the position of hong kong as a shop paradise ?
be it because of abundant merchandise or high quality at low price ?
be it a paradise for the rich or the general public ?
after all , what be the joyful memory from inside paradise ?
we respectfully invite you to watch hong kong : a shop paradise in this edition of across china .
hello , everyone .
this be the cross strait program on cctv international channel .
welcome to our program .
first let 's focus on the main content of today 's program .
wang jin - pyng say that he have decide not to continue serve as kmt vice chairman .
candidate for the giant panda to be present to taiwan as gift from the mainland may increase .
taiwan 's military use taipei aerospace exhibition as an opportunity for press arm procurement .
recently , the 2005 ningxia investment and trade fair and ningxia - taiwan economic and trade cooperation seminar be hold in the city of yinchuan .
more than three hundred taiwanese businesspeople gather in this land know as " lush southern - type field north of the great wall , " begin their tour and inspection journey .
well , what be the unique charm in ningxia of the western region that have attract the attention of so many taiwanese businesspeople ?
please watch this edition of hot topic analysis for a detailed report .
the kmt vice chairman arrive at party headquarters to meet with kmt chairman lien chan on the afternoon of %pw .
after a long talk of over an hour , wang jin - pyng express his wish not to renew his term as kmt vice chairman .
he say that he will follow lien chan as a lifelong volunteer .
%pw
he can n't seem to help himself from apologize for anything and everything .
hallmark could make a fortune off of this guy .
i do n't follow , why should he apologize to palin ?
did palin apologize to giffords ?
he need to conduct a beer summit between palin and nbc .
mend some fence and get this country move .
he could call it the apology on beer tour .
hell , sell ticket and hire the chinese to cater the event .
who drop out after super tuesday ?
i think romney win big today and obviously stay in .
santorum get enough of a boost to do the huckabee hang around .
i think gingrich 's sole win in ga be enough to hang it up and go back to make million in the private sector .
i think the good doctor be too crazy to hang it up .
i will stick around until the end .
no one
i think mitt drop out...
ok , my answer be no one and obama win the ge .
the only one with any reason to will be newt , but i do n't think that he will .
ron paul say tornado victim should not get aid
nut .
my heart go out to the people in tornado alley and i have no problem with my tax dollar go to help the survivor rebuild their life .
if you have no problem with your tax dollar go to aid them then you 'd have no problem donate to them of your own free will .
not to mention that he 's absolutely right that they should have insurance to cover them .
ron paul be not quite bright .
he 's right in some way but it do n't translate into be right across the board .
this be n't like someone 's house burn down and they make an insurance claim .
everything be go , the entire infrastructure be go .
even if someone have insurance to cover their loss , that won't extend to the road , power line , sewer , public building .
the problem with this regime be aid be not distribute equally .
democrat get it , minority get it , white republican jurisdictions do n't .
aid be now patronage , good party member get it .
be n't it interest how libertarian ' desire for " freedom " correspond so neatly with skinflint who do n't want to give anyone , anything .
so while libertarianism attract people who want to be " free " it also attract cheap asshole who do n't want to pay their fair share .
perhaps when libertarian figure out a way to differentiate between the two , i 'll vote for them .
i get what ron paul be say .
thats what a hardcore libertarian would say .
but the rest of us be think about the people that do not have insurance and @/@ or need help right now .
kind of hard to build a house over night , mr paul .
kind of hard to import food consider that the store be probably wipe out too .
how do one survive until the insurance( hopefully by a respectable company ) claim come through ?
how do one survive when you have the fund but the people you need to buy the goods from have no address ?
i know , you get into your pickup and drive over to the next town -- if you can find your damn pickup ! !
homeowners generally have insurance , but federal aid be necessary to provide for the clean up , repair of electrical and water system , road , school , bus , etc. etc.
keep in mind insurance company be not in the business of pay claim , they be in the business of make money .
anyone who suffer a loss as have those who lost everything over the weekend will not be make whole , and whatever claim they receive will not come soon or easy .
ron paul and his libertarian idea be at best impractical .
no surprise there .
he have to win there to stay in , so ultimately this help mitt keep the vote split .
best outcome of the night would have be newt lose there .
he 's a nonfactor at this point and only in out of spite .
if he be out of the race , santorum might have have a chance .
the catholic church be oppose to contraception for moral reason .
where be the morality in create a life when food and clean water be rare commodity ?
where poverty exist and educational opportunity be non existent ?
where be the morality when disease be spread ?
where be the morality when a women be the victim of domestic violence ?
when a women be force to conceive and then trap as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control ?
i be with you .
if you cant fee , house and take care of a baby you have no business have one .
why be it literally 100 % impossible for the liberal mind to understand that just because you do n't want government involve in something do n't mean you 're against it ?
i 'm in favor of feed , clothe , and give shelter to the poor . i 'm against all the gov't institution that tax our brain out and who inefficiently attempt to provide some of these thing .
now be i just a genius who do n't know it , or be it really not that hard to understand such a simple concept ?
will they try to prop romney up with a strong vp to help make him more palatable - or will they bring in a new face ?
either way , they 've get a big problem .
are n't you one of the asshole who assure us how romney be inevitable as the gop nominee ?
i do n't think standtorum will tank , its go to be a close one till the very end , i be still root for a romney @/@ mcdonnell ticket .
wow , another solyndra @-@ type company who take our money and fail in their goal .
they lay off 125 employee , but give big raise to executive .
another scam that the media will ignore .
after see those bus tour to aig execs home , promote on acorn 's website , i be wonder why those same people be n't outraged at this .
maybe because it would look bad for the guy who promise to pay their mortgage , put gas in their tank , give them free cell phone and increase the welfare roll .
of course , the people on the aig bus tour likely do n't get soak with high tax to pay for this scam , so why should they care ?
this be not surprising or shock to me .
obama must pay off his supporter by way of cash infusion and call it " stimulus " money .
he be not lie to call it stimulus .
it stimulate others to be big contributor so they may be in on the next wave of free cash from the boy king .
another victory for the left because there be more people in need .
the government will rush in and show these people that government dependency be better than work and provide for themselves .
that be the plan with all the liberal policy .
no one should be expect to practice self sufficiency or concern themselves with personal responsibility .
increase the welfare roll till the taker outweigh the giver . only then can socialism creep in .
everything obama have do be straight from alinsky 's rule for radical . all of it .
if some on the left want to remain ignorant and not read alinky 's book to prove it , that be on them .
for those in the know , this be all quite predicable .
dumb , dumb dumb...
i 've always be a critic of judge who decide they be go to disregard the will of legistlatures and the populace and impose these thing , but here 's a case where they do it the right way ,
they pass a bill , and christie the hutt decide he 's stull suck up to be rombot 's run mate .
christie be be set up on this one and the legislature call his bluff
it will make him a big shot with the gop in 2012 but by 2016 if he be to run for president " christie veto gay marriage " will be a millstone around his neck .
by 2016 most americans will have gay marriage available .
christies denial of marriage privleges to gay will alienate independent and his " i want to have the people vote on it " will ring hollow
it be santorum that be the by far major nonromney candidate and newt would appear to be the spoiler .
when the situation be reverse gingrich argue that santorum be help romney get the nomination and for the good of the conservative cause santorum should drop out .
now that the same logic would apply to gingrich drop out , should he ?
sure , why not .
i think santorum be go to be the last of the " not romneys ", and newt have have his moment .
who know . he may make a comeback .
of course money be a problem for him so he may have to drop out .
santorum or mitt . i could vote for either one .
no , why should he ?
he be , if nothing else , insure that he 'll be able to sell book after the election .
i mean you do n't really think that any of these guy really give a shit about their party or their nation , do ya ?
more than they care about themselves , i mean .
americans ' assessment of congress have hit a new low , with 13 % say they approve of the way congress be handle its job .
the 83 % disapproval rate be also the worst gallup have measure in more than 30 year of track congressional job performance .
ever notice that the more gridlock there be , the more congress ' rating go down .
in other word , congress should stop all the politcal bicker , put their head together and start working thing out in a real bi @-@ partisan format .
it work for reagan and clinton and look at the positive result .
i 'm not the least bit surprise .
i 'm still wait for pelosi to drain the damn swamp .
today on the senate floor durbin say healthcare premium will not go down and that the administration need to quit say that ! !!!
then nancy pelosi in the house say we need to pass the healthcare bill so " we can find out what 's in it....."
the democrat be slowy turn congress into bozo 's bigtop circus ! !!!!
the insurance industry 's own institute say premium would skyrocket .
how could they not ?
if you force them to accept pre @-@ exist condition and accept other insure 's currently not eligible because they cost too much , who be go to pay for that extra risk ?
you can n't legislate risk away . of course premium will rise .
the administration be in campaign mode , willing to say or do anything to get this turd pass .
the joke will be on house dems who be be promise a bill to " fix " the problem with teh senate bill .
anyone who believe that will happen be dream .
obama will hang them out to dry .
1. end the war in iraq
2. develop american energy independence
3. universal healthcare for all americans
work for me......
only if that mean it be over because we win .
and we will have some very strategically locate , large base to counter iranian and russian agression for the next 50 year .
a good thing , but he will have to include thing he oppose , like drill and nuclear power , along with coal power to get there .
only if he adopt hillary 's plan of mandatory universal participation .
which mean everyone , without exception , pay premium .
here be the thing that should be obama 's top priority .
#1 end the war in iraq
#2 bring us universal healthcare
#3 repeal nafta
#4 repeal the patriot act
#5 repeal taft @-@ hartley
#6 bring bush @/@ cheney up on criminal charge for war crime . ( send them to the haig ! !!)
#7 fire john bolton !
#8 strengthen the fisa act
#9 abolish the office of homeland security !
#10 prosecute john ashcroft !
what about when my favorite doctor quit because he be not go to take a pay cut ?
or just let the quality of his practice go down the tube ?
also , who be go to goto school for 15 year to be a doctor , with major student loan and only make a sub @-@ par government salary ?
i 'll tell ya what , if be go to goto school for 15 year , it would be for rocket science or computer engineer or something of that nature so i could easily make an above average salary .
last and most importantly , i never want to see any of my paycheck support some lazy person who do not work because the government pay for them to live their life .
i plan on vote against every single one of these dirtbags that call themselves representative .
our congress , be it the house or senate , be a bunch of non @-@ represent representative .
its as if the british red coat be in charge once again do whatever be best for themselves irregardless of the consitution .
i say kick them all out of office , and then do it again every election for the next several cycle until they get the hint .
we be not happy , we are not gonna take it anymore ! !!!
am i the only one or be some of you feel like this too ?
i 'm not a republican , i 'm not a democrat , i be an american ! !!!!
start respect my country , my consitution , and our national heritage or get fire @/@ vote out .
add your 2 cent people .
i 'll have a senator to vote for along with my representative , and senator voinovich be not run in 2010 so i 'll luckily have more option to vote for .
so far there be 3 candidate in the race that i 'm aware of , and i 'm not impress by any of them .
but hopefully somebody good pop up that i can support .
as far as my representative go , i can n't wait to vote against him .
i do n't vote ' against ' anyone .
i vote ' for ' the best candidate for the job , regardless of political affiliation ( unless , of course , they be un @-@ american , like libtards and neocons ) .
since none of the incumbent in my district will get my vote , i guess you could say i 'm vote ' against ' them , but i 'm still not comfortable with that term .
where would mccain be without sarah ?
a lot of us , include myself , have have fun poke , jab , make fun of palin , her lack of knowledge about the constitution , her appearance on snl , etc....
but at this late date in the race...
where would he , ( mccain ) , be if he do not have her as his run mate
imo.... she be help him more now , because he be hurt himself , more .
palin solidify the republican base for mccain .
she invigorate the far right winger to actually go out and campaign for mccain , instead of apathetically vote for mccain to spite obama .
palin be the real star behind the republican ticket this year .
if it be anyone else , mccain would not have a shot in hell .
palin invigorate obama 's campaign , and she be one of the reason obama raise $ 150 million dollar in september .
when i see her speech at the convention , i immediately sent obama as much money as i could .
presidential candidate : chuck baldwin ( c ) constitution party bob barr ( l ) libertarian mccain ( r ) cynthia mckinney ( g ) green ralph nader ( i ) independent obama ( d )
look like women have a candidate run for president .
why be n't women flock to her ?
what 's wrong with the green party ?
the woman be a nutjob .
she would make ralph nader look like barack obama .
why on earth would women vote for the green party just because they have a female candidate ?
sorry , i would n't have vote for hillary , either .
i would vote for sarah or condy .
the green party be the party for the libtards who be too crazy even for other libtards .
if the government provide health care , whether spell out in this bill or not , it will ration the care .
that be how it work .
the government can not afford to pay for everything for everyone , even if they take all our money .
and in fact the research that back up this health care bill out of the house spell it out clearly .
specifically it identify the elderly and those under the age of 2 as be less important and so they will be the first to suffer from reduce service .
know that the government can not efficiently run anything , i can promise it won't end there .
since all healthcare be ration , the question for me be do i want those decision to rest with corporation whose sole reason for existence be to make a profit --- profit which depend upon insure the healthiest among us , and deny coverage for those whom they may have to pay claim ?
corporation where profit be dependent on not provide the service i pay for ?
that can at any point in time decide to cancel my policy , leave me without any coverage at all and no prospect of obtain coverage on my own ?
that spend 1 @/@ 3 of their revenue in administrative overhead ?
i have not see much cold weather , or snow , here in the northeast .
meterologist say this will be a warm than usual winter this year .
many temperature have be above what be normal for this time of year .
be this winter weather go to be what winter will be like in the future.?
warm temperatures.?
be what global warm be about.?
hey stupid , maine 's get 4 @-@ 8 inch of snow tonight .
when it snow in october it be global warm too
52 nd street all up in the white .
i see mr. biker boy . thank for let me know .
whats the name of that motor cycle gang you belong to ? ?
its warm , therefore global warm
it 's snow , therefore global warm
when will it be too late to do anything about global warm ?
have we already guarantee our doom ?
so you be a warmist too ehh ?
sorry to hear .
the facts.... from about 1980 to 1998 we have a 1 @/@ 3 of a degree warm period .
this start the man make global warm claim .
another inconvenient fact for the man make global warm crowd . since 1998 until today there have be no significant warm .
a further fact . in the early 1900 's scientist predict that over the next 100 year the temperature would go up globally about 1 degree . and that be what it do .
so we have an 18 year trend that see a rise of 1 @/@ 3 of a degree world wide . follow to date by a 14 year period with no appreciable warm . remind me again how we be all doom ?
experience the great platonic year .
precission of the earth equinox refers to the earth 's axis wobble move in an unconventional way .
time period event be a 25765 yrs wobble path .
notice the ice cap weight shift it be due to earth own inertia and the sun moon alignment .
this vid indicate inertia shift in ice not to be due to global warm but due to physic of the earth , sun , moon system .
this inertia of the sun earth moon generate potential physical plate movement on earth , ie earthquake .
very cool stuff .
so be this because of global warm or be it bush 's fault ?
it 's a good thing the polar ice cap be shrink then right ?
this seem to explain the record snow fall in siberia and alaska .
nobody as yet really understand why periodically earth undergo geomagnetic reversal . but the wander magnetic pole seem to have be happen for the last 200 million year .
happen regularly , and seem to have little effect on the biosphere as a whole .
no unusual event in the paleo record seem to be associate with magnetic reversal .
but everyone know that what man make doesnt count huh ?
not , i suspect , as it relate to magnetic pole shift or drift .
you just know that some ignorant fool be go to blame pollution .
this be really eye open .
where be the environmentalist ?
have you see the trash along the road and in the ditch across this county ?
i see chair couch refrigerator and who know what else out here in the countryside .
people have no respect for their neighbors and i be talk about americans here .
if they have no respect for their neighbors or fellow countrymen how can they have respect for themselves ?
its not everybody but a small segment of our society but the question be how small be this segment ?
now that be precisely what i be referring to .
instead of focusing on the filthy habit of illegals violate our border , you go one a mission to deflect .
not today , pal .
stay on point !
whole apartment be shake .
far out and funky !
what the hell ?
two thumb say he feel this too in pa .
nothing here in birmingham though .
do you think earthquake at first ?
felt it here just outside of read , pa !
thought i be have a seizure or something at first , till i see the water in my water bottle sway back and forth .
the book shelf in my computer room be move back and forth .
weird dude .
was go on for like 20 second .
the time of water war be upon us with the privatization of water resource worldwide by multinational conglomerate who be not accountable to , or suppressible by the local population they effect , even here in america .
what say you ?
' flow , ' a documentary on what the privatization of water really mean which be the inspiration for me create this thread .
it bring to light the insane and completely immoral behavior of water corporation ( nestle , coke , pepsi , as well as suez and vivendi , and their involvement with the world bank ) ...
i be never go to buy another coke , pepsi , or nestle product until...
i be die of thirst , which be the situation many in the world find themselves in now .
allow the privatization of public water source be stupid beyond all understand .
water be resource of the commonweal and ought never to be allow to become capture by any private concern .
right now corporation like nestle be buy up the world 's best spring to make bottle water .
allow this to happen be a perfect example of how pervert our government have become .
hey........30 year ago , i be read about all kind of hysterical doomsday theory of the extinction of this natural resource or that natural resource .
you get a few decade down the line and realize there be lot of smart people out there who roll out hysterical theory because they know there be million of sucker out there who 'll buy it in a heartbeat and profit handsomely ftw ! !!
my wife work with the gao a lot and she send this report over to me .
they report on just how difficult it will be to regulate the amount of co2 be release .
http : //www.gao.gov/new.items/d10818.pdf
of course it will be difficult .
the energy company be put many , many ten of million of dollar into prevent anything at all from be done .
but we will probably start do it well after it will make no differance .
our grandchild will curse the blindness and greed of this generation .
i go to youtube and check out the gulf oil crisis : all of the post be one month old , or older...
how many million people post on youtube ?
the first two month there be hundred of private citizen with their video cam report about what be happen in the gulf... show everyone firsthand eyewitness account of the incompetence of bp and the lack of government response .
now there be none : zero : nobody have post one single video on youtube about the gulf oil crisi for one month .
this stink to high heaven .
do n't tell me nobody have post anything on the gulf crisis for one month : there be a media bl ; ackouit go on .
the last time something like this happen that i know of ; be the republican convention in new york for the renomination of bush jr for a second term in office .
would n't that be a youtube blackout , then ?
i mean , rather than a media blackout ?
gulf oil spill - google search = plenty of coverage about the oil spill still on the media .
that 's the point : the oil have not be clean up : its sunk below the surface : just like all the true fact have sunk out of sight .
the dispersant they use , corexit ; have destroy all possibility of clean up the oil because it 's make the oil sunk below the surface .
bp 's use of corexit be a quick way of sweep the problem under the carpet : idiot who do n't see the oil on the surface will assume that there be n't any ecological damage go on .
instead , the ecological damage to the entire area be now a million time worse than it be when the oil be still on the surface .
the oil beneath the surface : million and million of gallon of oil be kill all wildlife , all the fish , all the dolphin , all the crab , all the shrimp , everything .
to people who do n't live there : the horror of this catastrophe make worse by bp cannot be understate enough .
yes you read that correctly....lets just assign a number because we want too !
yeah that 's the ticket !
these clown commit this fraudulent behavior all the fricking time and old fraud , chris , konradv , troll blunder and a whole host of others ignore this .
what be so distort in their fundamental makeup that they can see this desecration of science and ignore it ?
in fact they support and revere it .
bizarre .
yes , they have be extrapolate temp for area where they have no direct measurement . however , as they state , one should use the ncdc measurement for those area , if very accurate measurement be desire .
yet , for all of watt yap , none of this change the fact that the warm continue , and differant agency have better accuracy in some place than others , depending on the method use .
another item concern watt .
he be not a meteorologist .
he be a fraud in that department .
tomorrow , the employment situation report come out and as usual , there will be idiot claim the government do n't count people not receive unemployment benefit , or that the government be n't count people who should be count etc.
so let 's discuss .
question : what exactly do we want to measure and why ?
answer : we want to measure the labor market and how it be change , especially how difficult it be to get a job .
first difficulty be that not everyone can freely participate in the labor market .
there be law and barrier afffecting group of people .
while children can work , there be significant restriction as to field , hour , change job etc.
at approx age 16 the restriction be go , almost all job be open for full or part time work .
so we ignore anyone under 16 .
next group be prisoner . while some " work " it 's not really a labor market system and work or not work be not free choice of entry and exit .
so we ignore prisoner .
next group be those mentally or physically incapable of work .
while many disable and those with psychological condition do work , those who be institutionalize or in long term care ( such as a hospice ) can n't .
so we ignore those in an institution or long term care .
there remain many disable who can n't work but be n't in an institution , but since some can and some can n't work , there 's no bright line , so we include them all .
next : retirees .
many country exclude those over the age of 65 .
for a country with mandatory retirement , or generous government pension , that be sensible as almost all those over 65 do n't need to work and do n't work and include them can distort the picture .
but in the us , there be no mandatory retirement ( except in military/police ) and retirement benefit be not as generous or universal .
so no maximum age limit for us .
last , military . for a while , they be count as employ ( 1984 @-@ 1994 ) but since there 's no free exit and it 's not a market system , include them just raise the number of employ by a fairly constant level , so it 's better to exclude the military .
so we have our population : the adult civilian non @-@ institutional population .
how do we divide that up ?
the key be to be as objective as possible .
since we have to use a survey ( it 's just not possible to do a full count every month ) , any subjectivity will increase our error , so we have to avoid any possible overlap or judgement call .
let 's look at employ .
who be employ ?
some have suggest a minimum number of hour work , but be that a good idea ?
plenty of people voluntarily work few hour , or in a particular week only work a few hour . should we say they do n't really have a job or be n't really work ?
that 's very subjecive . we do n't want to run into case be someone nomrmally work 40 hour a week , but in the particular week of the survey she only work 2 hour and count as unemployed .
so we set a bright line of 1 hour for pay , and also include those as employ people temporarily absent due to brief illness , injury , vacation , strike , bad weather etc.
we can always look at sub group later .
unpaid labor .
some people do n't get pay ( directly ) for work , either charity work or work on a family farm or family business .
let 's not include charity work , because that 's not really part of the labor market .
but family business @/@ farm be a different story...the person be either just help out , ( mean if they do n't already have another job they would n't take one if they be n't work for family and @/@ or no one would have to be hire in their place ) or they be a substantial part of the business prevent them from another job and fill a job slot no one else can take .
so let 's set a bright line of 15 hour a week and anyone work without pay on family business farm 15 hour or more a week be employ .
what about someone hire but not yet work ?
many thing can happen , so we won't call them employ until they 're actually work .
now for the unemployed .
in casual usage , this can mean many different thing , but what we want be a precise , objective definition .
and what we 're look for be available worker who be n't work .
this have an impact on the labor market..supply over demand .
some people do n't want to work...retirees , housewives/husbands , full time student , and some people on drug or alcohol or criminal or lazy .
so let 's not count anyone who do n't want a job .
should we count everyone who say they want a job ?
they could be lie .
they could be unable to take a job if offer ( mean they 're not available labor ) .
so what bright line can we set ?
if someone be actually look for work , send a resume , go to an interview , on the union list , then we can safely assume that they be really available for work .
but if someone be n't do anything about a get a job , then they 're not available , anymore than someone who do n't want to work .
sure they may still consider themselves " unemployed " and they may sincerely want to work , but since they 're not available , since they 're not part of the actual supply of labor and can n't be hire , we exclude them .
so we have our employ , we have our unemployed....this be our labor force , our available supply of people who can work or be hire .
everyone else be not in the labor force .
since the population tend to grow , for an historical comparison , it 's better to look at rates/ratios/percentages to get a clearer picture .
labor force participation rate : the labor force as a percent of the population .
this can be largely affect by non @-@ economic factor as the increase of women into the labor force in the 60 s and 70 s show , but it give a good look at how much of the population be try to work .
employment @-@ population ratio : this tell us the percent of the population that 's actually work .
again , non @-@ economic factor play a role but look at the change can tell us useful thing .
unemployment rate : unemployed as a percent of the labor force .
this tell us how much of available labor...people willing and able and available to work... be not be use .
this be all economic factors...the percent of people try and fail to get a job .
do this give a complete picture of the labor market ?
of course not...it 's not meant to .
it do n't tell us type of job , if people be work as much as they want to , people who do n't believe they would be successful .
but it tell us what we 're look for : the percent of people who we know for sure cannot get a job .
i think that explain the basics .
i 'll be happy to clarify question or discuss any real issue .
the issue be simple , when 150k job be create and you need 250 to maintain...
yet the ue rate go down.2 % then you have a choice...
you can make believe thing be get better or you can understand that thing be get worse and deal with it .
you choose to make believe .
neither side expect the other to be consistant .
i remember the libs make this argument during the reagan year .
of course , the real cuteness be during the carter year during the run up to the 1980 election when the military be add to the employ part of the picture .
presto , 2 million more employed person and the unemployment rate when down by a substantial fraction .
that get quietly reverse after the election .
what be important here be that unemployment be no long the short term thing it have usually be .
we have people look for work who have be look for three year or more .
we have folk just plain resign from the work force and do n't look any more .
people who four year ago have successful career .
even under the regime of 99 week unemployment rather than 26 week , we have large number who have go beyond benefit .
to maintain what ?
and do " it " need to be maintain ?
or you can do actual analysis of the data .
" job " come from the current employment statistic survey ( ces ) while unemployment ( and total employment ) come from the current population survey ( cps ) .
the ces be non @-@ farm payroll employment . it exclude agriculture , the self @-@ employ , unpaid family worker and private employee ( private cook , nanny , maid , etc ) .
so " job " may go up 150k , but total employment go up 300k .
you can n't directly compare 2 measure that measure different thing .
much of the drop in ue have be for the wrong reasons...a decrease labor force .
that be not the case for the january drop .
at best thing have be spotty lately...up and down .
you can n't just look at one number or one measure and say " thing be good " or " thing be bad ."
the best unit of measure be , i think to determine how many americans be work .
instead we get report on the number of people who self report they be n't work but be look for work .
to find out all we have to do be ask bernie sander and remember that obama vote to the left of sander while in the senate .
god help us all if obama ever get to appoint a liberal inflationist fed chairman .
oh , and we might remember that when their god , keynes , be ask about the future consequencs of his ultra easy monetary policy he say , do n't worry about the future , we 'll all be dead .
bernie sander : another very important issue be with unemployment so high , how can we strengthen the fed 's full @-@ employment mandate[ with inflation] and ensure that it conduct monetary policy to achieve maximum employment ? [ through inflation].
in other word the fed have a number of mandate and one of them be to control inflation .
but one of them also be to pursue policy that lead to full employment .
be the fed do that in an adequate way ?
well i would argue that by definition when you have 16 % of people unemployed and underemployed it really be not .
they 'd do exactly what they 've do since 1913 .
lend out " money " that do n't exist , charge interest for it , inflate the hell out of the currency and line their pocket in the process .
then , they 'd bankroll endless stupid foreign war , the socialistic welfare state , massive ponzi scheme , endless bailouts of state , city , corporation and foreign nations....
the same thing a conservative fed would do , and then they 'd call it brilliant and give obama the credit .
an ngdp target can fix the unemployment problem without result in inflation .
that 's a gross misunderstand of the keynes quote .
what he 's say be n't , obviously , that we should n't care about the long run .
what he 's say be that economist be take the easy way out only ever consider the long run .
we need not only theory of the long run , but also theory of the short run .
nobody can " fix the unemployment problem " ....
this be the fatal conceit of socialistic central planner come out of the chute .
" global warm be real - it be man @-@ make and it be an important problem . but it be not the end of the world." - who say it ?
bjørn lomborg - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia
i think this issue be only valuable for the purpose of support commoditization of co2. that 's my explanation for why all of the fund scientist point to the gas and build the anthro argument . i dont see how it be credible in light of more dominant cause .
i 'm curious dante...dosen't the temp change by about 40 degree , every year , in the northern and southern hemisphere ? also , with warm temp and more co2 in the atmosphere , would n't the number and variety of plant and tree increase ? what ever happen to the rain forest , nuclear meltdown , ozone layer , global cool , or any of the other iminent catastrophe that will befall us if we do n't do something right now ! !? the only environmental issue important to envronmentalists be whatever one can generate the most money . at least oil company get their cash by provide us with something we need . you enviro @-@ whackos get yours by do absolutely nothing at all , except make life hard for everyone else .
in reality human contribute about 5 % to global worm in term of co2 release into the atmosphere . yes it be true that we be responsible for this number and try to minimize it in whatever way we can , but human be not ultimately the source of global worm . it be arrogant of us to think that we can effect the ecosystem of the world in such a drastic way in only 20 year . science be divide on the issue with scientist in government lab report that global warm be an imminent threat cause by human and only we can save the planet while scientist at university and private organization generally suggest that man be not the ultimate cause and in reality contribute little . the ipcc have publish documentation and recommendation about global warm at regular interval and it be not until one of their more recent publication that they completely overturn their previous data show global warm to be natural in favor of new data that show global warm to be human cause . the problem be that they use the same relative data set and simply change the way it be view to maximize the human contribution . they have also be know to falsify information to suit their purpose and destroy information that prove them incorrect .
so it would appear that politics drive natural history and our relation to the ecosystem...inherent problem there .
consider too rapid climate change event as document by paleoclimatological data from ice core drill out of antarctica and atmospheric analysis of gas freeze in the ice . this heat process occur every 22,000 year like clockwork for the past 150,000 year that our record go back . guess what...it have be just about 22,000 years...fancy that .
remember in the 80 s when the next ice age be around the corner and we be all go to freeze to death ?
very simple . adapt to a rapidly change climate be preferable to change our present habit , no matter how destructive they be to the come generation , or to the rest of the biosphere .
for most people , the present rapid change be already stretch their ability to adapt . they see job that they consider safe niche now go forever , with no demand for skill that take year to develop , and now the scientist be tell them that they have to change even more . that we should cease to use fossil fuel asap , that we need to switch to an energy base that feature nuclear , wind , solar , geothermal , and other non @-@ pollute source , that they do not understand , and have no experiance with .
i see otherwise intelligent people convince themselves of the scientific equivelant of the sun rise in the west simply because they wish to avoid any more change in the life , and the way that they live . which , of course , push the change onto their children , and grandchildren , who will be face a much more serious situation concern the effect of a change climate , a rapidly change climate , than we face today .
well , that be the culture of this nation , and our children will suffer the consequence of our inability to face reality .
how long would we live if we could replace body part with exact match ?
how about replace our whole body and exchange brain with that of a clone ?
someday the micro surgery techiques will be available .
would you participate ?
i would if it be sure fire .
they be patent human gene right now .
perhaps one have an inalienable right to patent one own body and its specific type .
do we own our own uniqueness ?
your thought ?
interest book...last child in the woods...talk about how this generation have accept the merge of man/machine/animals....that there be about 2000 patent life forms...
i be not real sure what that mean but i be sure xox can explain it...
i find the idea of " cloning " sillie...
the so call " clone " be a human from your cells...not a spare part factory for you .
be there not still question concern the aging of cell in the " clone " animal or person...
that dollie 's lamb ( remember the sheep that be cloned ) age fast due to her age at the beginning....
so you would have to clone your infant...
now tell me....you have spare infant identical to the one you give birth too and your not gonna love it....
now that would be a brave new world .
would i be able to order clone of elisha cuthbert and jessica alba that i could keep as sex slave ?
if so , count me in .
go ahead and slap a property tax on them too , i 'm good for it .
31 us troop be kill when the chinook carry them crash .
may they rest in peace and condolence to the family and love one of these brave young men .
365 coalition troop kill this year ? man , that 's a lot .
i do n't realize the casualty be that high this year .
our msm do n't seem very interested in cover the afghan war much . i 'm really not sure why .
that 's bad but this be the unnecessary war bush start .
this be war and people die in war .
over one million iraqi death cause by us occupation
this happen in 2010 .
they be the first and only one , i believe .
they do the same train , make it through .
that be pretty cool .
it 's like the " softest " branch of the military and the tough assignment together .
so these guy can be sit in a bar next to some marine .
marine say , " so what be you ? "
and they say , " we 're in the coast guard ."
and maybe they snicker a little , but they should n't !
what make people assume the coast guard be the softest branch ?
ignorance ?
maybe you never serve in any military branch and have no frame of reference ?
not to diminish the great navy fleet sailor who keep the gigantic ship run with all kind of technical skill , coast guard people be the real sailor who navigate tiny boat in high sea to rescue people , arrest criminal and keep america 's shore safe .
it 's not surprising that they could complete seal train if they want to .
i 've be read through several news site tonight and i just pick up on a great story about a us air force pilot who probably save a lot of us military life in the early going of the iraq war .
now let 's get one thing straight , i initially agree with the reason for go into iraq , but i no long agree with it .
i support obama 's decision to pull our troop out by next year .
i always , 100 % side with our brave men and women who be put themselves in harm 's way .
now today , i come upon this story on tv .
lieutenant colonel victor fehrenbach .
he be promote to lt. colenel in 2006 .
he 's part of the 325 th fighter wing mission that serve off of tyndall air force base fly f @-@ 15c 's and f @-@ 22 raptors .
he 's be in the air force for 18 year .
he be just 2 year short of retirement .
he 's fly mission in iraq , afghanistan , kosovo and have be await re @-@ deployment a new tour of duty .
if you know anything about air force , he 's afelm jt fly trng .
back in 2003 this hero win the air medal for heroism .
back in april , 2003 the army be make the initial advance to capture baghdad int'l airport , victor and his wingmen find an iraqi ambush site of about 12 apcs that be less than a mile from the army advance .
at the time , his wingman be suffer from a major malfunction in his plane that prohibit him from deploy his weapon .
within a timespan of 20 @-@ 30 minute , he and his wingman be finally able to deploy all of their weapon and destroy the 8 apcs that be about to ambush the us army on their mission to take baghdad international airport .
they take out the entire enemy position and that night the army capture baghdad international airport .
why be i post this when there have be several hundred if not thousand of other us soldier , seamen and pilot who have each serve their country heroicly and have also win medal , which some have even die for ?
because this hero be 2 year away from retirement and be be discharge , against his will , from the air force . be this because of bad behavior ? no. he have an excellent record of service and have never have any problem . then why , if this 18 @-@ year veteran who be an excellent pilot of the us air force be discharge against his will , 2 year before he retire ?
because he 's openly gay . he 's command squadron , save other american soldier ' life and serve with honor .
but because he be different than we be , because he be sexually attract to men , his sexuality trump the incredible record of service he 's have over 18 year .
are you tell me that the most professionally train , the meanest , the fiercest military in the world that can destroy any other enemy and accomplish any goal its give , cannot accept men or women who have different seuxality taste than other people ?
this do n't ask , do n't tell law absolutely must be repeal immediately !
men and women who fight to save our country , who be more than willing to die to protect our freedom , must not be discriminate against .
it 's time to end prejudice and time to accept human being for who they be - espeically our heroic men and women in the us military . support our troop !
all of them !
in these troubled time we simply cannot do without this significant portion of potential enlistees , and talented senior member , to uphold an absurd , and bigoted , policy .
most absurdly , we be allow ourselves to fire arabic language specialist , people whose position be critical at this time , due to a trait that have no effect on the performance of their duty .
i know congress have a lot on their plate right now , but they need to move on this soon .
preferably with a solution that would allow soldier lose to this idiotic policy to reenlist if they still wish to .
its not that the military be against gay .
the military be against thing that make it run less efficiently .
allow black to enter the military increase its number and productivity thus the long term goal outweigh the short term unease .
allow openly gay men @/@ women into the service would create long term discomfort and you would see a decrease in troop number as well as military efficiency .
because of the nature of the military and close quarter share especially among men in war simulation , train and actual warfare the distraction of have someone who you know may be attract to you can ultimately cause death because you be distract .
as part of the army ?
they do pretty much the same thing though the army have the much more elite unit and more highly train infantry .
the army , as demonstrate by its successful execution of d @-@ day during wwii , be also capable of make dare amphibious assault , so why not just disolve the marine into the army ?
you be aware that the marine corps be the only service that be protect by congressional act ?
the marine corps must maintain a minimum of 3 division and can not be disband without a congressional act .
this be do in the early 1950 's because of reject like you .
because the navy need bodyguard for the officer corps and a expeditionary force , too .
leave the fuck marine alone .
they 're one of the few organization i still have some respect for in this nation .
to be honest , the army be a great service .
i have serve with several stellar performer from 2id and 3 rdarmored .
got friend in the 101 and 82 nd airborne or airmoble .
the bottom line ( and the hook and sinker ) be that man for man , and dollar for dollar the army cannot match the " kick in the door " specialty that our marine do .
btw i do a force on force with the 10 th mountain in the late 80 's .
they be attempt to go @-@ light and be use our fmfm 's to teach em technique .
and besides , they aint ready to be marine yet .
you just know i have to weigh in on this one !
each service and the marine have their unique role .
there be of course some similarity and overlap between them .
that be what allow the us military great flexibility in operational execution .
fund will always be an issue .
each service think their requirement be more important than the other service 's .
because not everything get fund , we go to war with the military we have and not the military we want .
obviously , there have be interservice rivalry since the first ship went to sea with fight men on board .
the army have brotherhood beef with the marine but we recognize that the marine be a unique unrivaled infantry machine .
the army have the ability to meet any infantry requirement anywhere and be set up for long term mission .
the long term ability of the army mesh 's with the immediate ferocity of the marine .
they be far from the same and if combine would defeat the purpose of their original design .
a funny story ( at least to me ) .
i have two son in the marine corp , both of whome recently complete their mos train and head to their permanent duty station .
one of them go through mos school at fort leonard wood , mo .
he be tell me that the army trainee 's have top salute the marine ( no matter their rank ) ....
that to me show the respect that the army have for the elite us fight force...and a respect that would be lose if they be part of the army .
he also tell me that the air force guy get additional pay for be station on the same base as marine and that the marine be not allow to go round in group of more than 4 , because they be concern about what they could do to anyone .
be afraid...be very afraid....usmc all the way ! !!!
man , how the hell can people do this ? ?
and a mother especially.....where be the motherly love and the mother instinct to protect her children ? ?
blind rage be just that @- blind .
i once find myself hold a steak knife @- ready to plunge it into my chest .
and i do , in my mind .
i be already dead .
but by some other force , i do n't .
i still do n't know why .
it be one of but two miracle that i 've witness in my life .
folk black out so to speak .
they black out to one singular vision that be a reality of past present and future . and for that i hold them ( and once myself ) harmless .
drug . valle have over 20 different kind of drug she be take .

i want to say something else too though .
i watch a documentary about tyson once , it be one that focused more on his fight career than his personal life .
my god , as a boxer that young man be simply awesome - and that be not a word that i use very often .
if i remember correctly he win 19 out of his first 20 professional fight by first round knock out , generally consummate by a left @-@ upper @-@ cut struck on the jaw that would lift a 220 @-@ pound man two feet off the mat .
its impossible to compare athlete from different era .
in golf alone the equipment be so much better now than it be even 10 year ago let alone 20 or 30 year ago .
its also impossible to compare the competition level .
i do n't think tyson be ever slate to be the greatest boxer of all time .
regardless of his skill , he never have the competition during his era to be consider the greatest
ali defeat liston , frazier , norton and forman who be all better than anyone tyson ever face
i find out today that the blockbuster video that i go to be closing down .
this be the fourth store in my area to close in the last year , and i 'm actually a bit upset about it , because the few that remain be n't close enough to drive to .
blockbuster already drive the mom and pop videostores out of business , and they be be drive out by movie on line , movie on demand , and movie by mail @- business they be try to get into .
i guess some would call this progress , but i think we be lose something as well .
redbox be a simple version of blockbuster , in that you can still go to a redbox and browse and get a movie right then and there .
i actually prefer the redbox because it do n't have nearly as much selection .
enough but not so much that i stand there for an hour , you know ?
all of the blockbuster around us close down .
you can get some great deal on movie @/@ tv show as they unload their inventory .
they drop the price each week so if you 're look for something in @-@ particular , nows a good time to keep an eye out for it .
also , when ours close down they offer a free movie ( that you be buy anyways , i think whatever the cheapest movie you be purchase ) and a month free of blockbuster online ( it 's like netflix ) .
you can just cancel before the one month timeframe be over .
i take them up on the offer... good deal .
for me , part of the fun of rent movie be go to the store with your chick and pick them out , bullshit with other people in the store , etc.
god forbid we have to leave the house for an hour and move our limb .

i assume he assume after report it up the chain that something would be do .
i do though think the school make the right move last night , just wish joe have be able to go out on a more positive note after what he 's do for nearly fifty year at psu .
wish him a long and happy retirement .
how interesting be this .
some guy be go to tweet wwii in " real time " as it happen way back when .
i imagine you could tweet vintage ww2 headline daily but not much else .
the minutiea of such an undertake be indeciperable .
this quest be noble .
julia gillard have beat her predecessor kevin rudd in a ballot for the federal labor leadership by a margin of 73 vote to 29 .
follow event as they happen on our live blog .
2. rudd have say he would retire if he lose .
now be not the time to be bicker with an election come .
4. i 've be in new zealand the past two weeks...
...where the australian political story have be top news .
the local paper be of the opinion that , whomever win the leadership contest , the labour party be likely to be heavily damage go into next year 's election .
local ows activist be part of this protest .
file this under " holy s***!"
hundred of protester from various group converge on the state capitol in topeka , kansas today .
shortly before the protester arrive , capitol police discover a truck laden with explosive park outside the capitol .
yeah , this sound like bullshit .
one , the protester be not targeted .
that 's an invention of the blog reprint this .
second , i have a really hard time believe that there be any actual " explosive , " since the news story they link to talk about one guy get arrest for threaten governor brownback .
nothing about explosive charge , etcetera , which they 'd be quick on top of if there be any actual explosive .
given the way these story get exaggerate , " several improvise explosive device " could mean anything down to a few bundle of firecracker -- or nothing at all , since false report be n't at all uncommon .
doubly so since they apparently do not even bother to tow the truck , so clearly there be n't a serious threat .
translation out of hype @-@ speak : some kook make threaten noise at brownback and get arrest . the end .
of what am i try to convince you ?
i 'm express my own view here .
what you believe be of concern only in term of debate .
and possibly add to my knowledge if i 'm convince there 's justification .
so far , not .
if that article represent the final word on " substance " to you , that 's fine with me .
i be , and remain skeptical .
i 'm sure they find something .
hard to make any case at all without something tangible .
what it be , who put it there , and why remain , for me , unknown , and also remain decide factor for me .
wingnut @/@ hard for me to grasp . goodness , disagree with you cause personal attack . not hard to believe when consider the weakness of your argument .
this be excellent news , we need a counter balance !
it be reveal in january that rupert murdoch @/@ news corp be create the right wing spanish version of fox news .
1. what make u think these channel will be a counter balance to anything lol nt
2. because when all else fail , i still trust in mickey !
3. disney 's abc network have be rate the second most conservative news coverage .
still , a conservatively biased channel be preferable to a conservative propaganda channel , which be what the fox spanish channel will certainly be .
4. how be univisions coverage ?
i understand that it be a center leave network .
i turn on my coputer this morning and instead of open the internet to my google home page ( white ) it open to a page call " blackle " which be black .
i think , hmm , they do funny thing with the google letter for holiday , so maybe today be blackle wednesday or something .
i " blackled " it and find out they change the page to black to save energy .
do this make sense ?
any teeth to this and if so , do it make enough of a differrence for web developer to switch ?
i just googled google and when i click on the first selection it take me to the white google page , so apparently we still have a choice .
the new search from google have the blackle.com address , not google .
also , when we have a choice for skin , like i think we do ( or do at one time ) here on a2k , then we could all contribute to the energy savings by use the black skin , right ?
so , we could participate that way , too .
( although i find the black page hard to read.)
anyone familiar with the working of energy that could explain the black page use less ?
or , whether or not it be that significant ?
only so long as they have no redeem quality , i imagine .
it be always wrong to kill anybody , whatever they have do .
i hear it cost upwards of one million dollar to execute one prisoner ; that sure buy a whole lot of year in prison .
a concurrent thread have touch on the the role of religion in the us civil right movement , and its place in the us constitution .
be the " equality " issue " religious wish fulfilment " which fly in the face of biological and sociological " fact " ?
i think you be answer if two men be the " same " and not necessarily if they be equal in right or should be .
t k o
i see equality as a goal to strive for , although in effect , it be somewhat arbitrary , dependant on the whim of change time .
while ride the bus earlier this week , i overhear a man say that if he " have the gut to do it , " he would jump off an overpass .
he follow up with an affirmation that he would never do it because he would never find those gut .
we be probably all familiar with the traditional say regard suicide - that it be a " coward 's way out ."
my question be this : be it really ? or be it the opposite ?
that be , do the act of suicide actually require courage to commit ?
personally i believe it require a tremendous amount of courage and perhaps the greatest amount of courage of any possible action .
after all , we be speak of terminate one 's own life , perhaps forever end one 's existence .
we all have our thought on what come next , but no one can be certain .
one may be forever end his existence , or he may be forever subject himself to punishment if the religious view on suicide be a sin be correct .
either way though , one be enter the unknown by willingly terminate his life , which blatantly violate the biological drive to live , to continue exist .
how can this not be an extremely courageous act , much more so that " find the courage to remain alive in the face of unbeatable problem ? "
remain alive to face one 's problem be continue the state of existence that one have always know .
end that life be journey into something new , something that may be better or may be worse than the current state of existence the individual be comfortably familiar with .
either way he be terminate his life and accept the state of death that deep down we all fear .
how can one consider voluntarily enter that state cowardly ?
@elmud , well , i think your reason have merit :
[indent]one be fearful of some thing one overcome their fear to do that thing in so do , one can therefore say to have courage [/indent]
so yes ; strictly speak , i think you 're correct .
although i must admit , it strike me as very unproductive to give praiseworthy word to such an act .
" he have the courage to kill himself "; though correct in this sense , lead to a ' destructive ' conclusion .
as a side note , labeling it as a " cowardly " or " easy " way out - i think - be simply people use derision to express their disapproval .
such disapproval may be certainly warrant - and i disapprove of it generally - but what one must go through ( mentally , emotionally and @/@ or experiencially ) can hardly be call " easy ".
i can also envision a state where , for me , such a solution could be warrant ; not a good one to be sure , but conceivable nonetheless .
to fight with every last stitch of breath for even the most @-@ remote possibility for " thing get better " be what i hold to .
interest twist on the issue . thank for post
@withoutreason , it be a purely courageous act , especially if you prepare for it so that it be least painful for your love one .
i do n't know if it could be argue as a logical choice , per se , especially if you have not yet try let go of all the thing that bring you down ( psychologically speak ) .
but , if you just get your arm and leg blown off by and ied , then by all mean , have at it . ( err...have someone do it for you.)
accord to most analyse , from within and without the petroleum industry , the world supply of oil , relative consumption , will effectively peak in the next decade .
what do this mean ?
if demand exceed supply , someone will neccessarily have to go without .
the issue be who ?
some nation will be price out , most likely the relatively undeveloped country in which automotive transportation be not really essential .
however , when there be not enough oil to satisfy even the industrialized nation , which totally depend on oil not only for transportation , but for farm , various chemical industry , etc. , how will they likely respond ?
obviously , war be a possiblity ; they have be fight for far less in the past .
of course , access to petroleum itelf be not the only issue .
most of the world 's food be grow use modern farm method that require enormous amount of gas .
if the amount of surplus food suddenly decrease as a result of peak oil , the poor around the world will starve , lamentable in itself , cause instability that could lead to conflict over scarce resoures .
china come to mind .
the economy of that nation be be build , with questionable logic by the central planner , on the western model : i.e. dependent on cheap petroleum .
what be unique about china be that the rule party 's legitmacy be intimately assosciated with rapid economic progress .
if this be suddenly to halt or risk collapse , would that rule party push the country into war , either to acquire access to oil or simply as a distraction , as so many authoritarian regime have do in the past ?
there be shift of power occuring in asia , as china and russia exert their influence .
the shangai cooperation organization of which they , along with ian , pakistan and most of the former soviet republic , be memebers , have state that it intend to remove u.s. influence from the region and failitate the rise of a ' multi @-@ polar world .'
i do n't want to guess their specific motive , but it seem to me that such an arrangement could be very advanategous for those nation in the event of a crisis bring on by peak oil .
between russia and iran , they would have access to enormous oil reserve , from which they could , if supply be too short , deny the u.s. saudi arabia come to mind as well .
as anyone who have do even the most superficial research on that nation would know , the house of saud be a joke , a paper tiger and a tyranny hate by most of its people .
if election be hold their , or if there be a struggle for power , the regime that woudl arise would be friendly with iran and extremely antagonistic to the u.s.: quite understandably i might add .
with the largest oil reserve in the world , it be vital that the u.s. maintain contorl over saudi arabia , which mean prop up the house of saud , and it would be equally benificial to iran or to china and its partner in asia to facilitate a revolution there , which would allow them greater access by default .
and so , after all that , which you might justly consider paranoia , my question be basically this ; in light of the threat of peak oil , and of the general decline in american economic might relative the rest of the world ( not to mention the current u.s. crisis ) , what do think the world will look like in a decade or two ?
if american hegemony fail , as appear inevitable , what will be its replacement ?
nice post and important issue .
i really , really hope that alternative source be be as enthusiastically @-@ pursue as the urgency of the situation dictate they should .
but the first , perhaps facetious , response i have to " what would happen "-question be to recall the 80 's movie : mad max , and mad mad : road warrior
i 'll admit though : there 's a part of me that want to see all this fossil @-@ fuel b.s. come tumble down .
even if it set transportation , technology and civilization in general back some , i 'd think a " reboot in a better direction " ( read : away from finite resource , fossil fuel ) be so much the better .
yea , more war over oil resource be likely ; perhaps even inevitable .
there be no question that the come century will see a confluence and will be a critical turn point in human history .
peak oil will be one of the primary driver of this process .
we may very well be call upon to choose between collective life and death .
the potential be there for both .
if we so choose to do so the technology we will have available in the near term future be perfectly capable of salvage the situation .
but if we do n't and we allow our technological civilisation to collapse under its own weight , the next generation of human will have to do without the major step stone of an oil based economy .
there simply will not be enough oil leave .
they may not be able to kickstart their own industrial era .
i think what you be go to see be a shift towards localize economy .
as the oil supply become smaller and population grow there just will not be enough to fee the system .
hopefully , people realize that it be go to take oil to move beyond oil , so the focus should be use what be readily available wisely , before the shift become extremely expensive .
i just read of arthur c clark 's death in sri lanka -- he be primarily know as a science fiction author , but his science fiction presage many of the technology that we now consider plebian .
his prediction of geosychronous satellite in the 40 's be now so utilitarian that this 24 hour equatorial orbit be now know as the clark orbit ,
many other of his ' fiction ' have now become casual technology .
i remember when he do that show " mysterious universe " about enigma and theory about thing like easter island , great pyramid , and stonehenge .
great man , great body of work , a truly enlighten soul who will revisit us again i 'm sure .
see you in the blink of an eye , buddy .
this be sad news .
i enjoy his book and his perspective on thing .
another giant gone .
shame nobody ( except a quoted person ) spell his name right .
i could n't for the life of me figure out where to post this question , so i think i 'd put it here since it 's biologically relevant... somewhat .
do n't ask me why but i need to know what happen if you dye your eyebrow .
say you want to disguise yourself by bleach dark hair blonde and that you want to do the eyebrow as well to complete the disguise .
now the hair on your head will eventually grow and you 'll lose the blonde @-@ ness , but what about the eyebrow ?
i do n't remember ever have them cut or trim , so would they stay blonde ?
eyebrow have a different " terminal length " than head @-@ hair -- that be , they grow to a certain length ( and not longer ) , then fall out .
they 're still go through the growth process , though .
the old one fall out , the new one fall in .
so it 'd have to be re @-@ done at interval , yep .
this excessive concern with little eyebrow be a trifle odd .
i do n't think soz be look to disguise herself .
i think she 's on the vamp .
accord to darwin it be the male who do the vamp .
what 's the scientific explanation of the reversal in human ?
its the same with long @-@ haired dog and short @-@ haired dog .
the short haired dog have hair strand that ( on the average ) fall out or break before the average long @-@ haired dog 's .
eyebrow hair grow much slower than head hair , so if you dye everything together , your head hair will show " root " long before the eyebrow do .
i dye my eyebrow all the time , whether i 'm do a touch up to the root , or my entire head .
so , that 's every 2 week .
i do n't know how fast my eyebrow grow , but after 2 week there 's always a grey one in there somewhere .
i guess they grow as fast as women seem to need to pluck them .
btw , when you 're die them , use a q @-@ tip , and make sure you get it all the way to the root .
i rather suspect that the " there be a god who always be -- and the god create what we see and can infer exist " scenario have more appeal forl you .
am i correct ?
a " theory " be nothing more than an explanation of know facts...when and if the fact change , the theory would be expect to change . therefore , any propose " theory " that be not support by know fact be to be reject . however , support for any one theory do not
automatically lead to a rejection of a second or even a third if those
theory be also support by the fact .
fact , not interpetations , be the basis for evaluation . an open and
curious mind and a regard for truth be still the basis for good science .
media coverage and political support be not .
it 's a common argument that the universe be tune " just so " for life to exist , and that any slight modification mean that " life " would be impossible .
but this premise assume that life as we know it be the only form of life that *can* exist . and i disagree with this assumption .
the life we see around us evolve in this universe as condition allow , so it 's not surprising at all that everything fit nicely . other universe with different rule would necessarily have life in them which fit that universe . and universe which be sterile have no life in them to question the fact that they be not there .
the really interesting thing to realize be that life evolve in universe ( at least this one ) at all . be the evolution of life in a universe pure chance , or be it inevitable ?
in our universe at least , life not only can exist , but do exist . and that mean that our universe be itself , alive , in a very real sense . and we be its thought .
a variant on the multi universe which seem to me obvious , and very real , be the infinite universe .
here the universe that we perceive be simply one cell of infinity , the others be like or unlike " cell " beyond our own , but fill the remainder of " everything " beyond our specific " this " with " otherthings ", identical , or not .
if we look at the magnitudinal stratification of this universe we go from , as we interpret it , and with our current ability to decern at sub nano level , the smallest subatomic particle through atom , molecule , solid , construct , and on , and on , and on , to planet , star system , galaxy , and on to our entire known universe .
would it not be foolish to assume this " mandelbrot " like lattice would stop at the extreem of our meagre ability to observe , rather than continue to follow its serial makeup to unimagined level of structure , and beyond to infinity ( infinity , of course not be a point , but rather a lack of constraint quantifier ) .
multiverse
i be work on a research project on the concept of the multiverse and while i enjoy the incoherent ramble argument on whether there be a god or not im feel kind of empty . the universe be the way it be because if it werent then we wouldnt be able to contemplate on whether therte be a god or not . and try to justify the existence of god through anything deal with relativity be laughable . god be only able to exist through faith . and faith go against everything that science stand for .
a key issue in disscussion of " life " and " universe " be what constitute " structure " or " order ". for example , to take bgw 's ( and capra 's ) fractal model of embed " structure " we be still leave with the regression problem of " who observe @/@ define such structure ".
my own conclusion be that term like " multiverse " have no separate reality with respect to a singular concept whilst the criteria for " reality " concern explanation of what we call " event " in the single universe . i be say that the occurence of " life " be not an " event " in the usual sense because event presuppose " observer " who classify them as such . ( observation in " our mind eye " be cognitive sleight of hand ) note also the term " multi " imply " one who classify or count " and we can ask again who be this other than ourselves ?
in short , the corollary the universe appear like it be because we be like we be be equally valid .
the transcendent question be of course " what constitute explanation " and how can this encompass the interaction of observer and observe ?
rather than take a reductionist view propose infinite , slightly different universe that somehow interact ( alah m @-@ theory ) , allow for strong emergence via the landauer @-@ lloyd analysis of flaw in the of the laplace 's demon argument that support reductionists . basically this state the final outcome of a system may not be soley define by outcome write into the basic law of physic * a gazzillion atom , but there can be " a cosmic imperative " write into the law of nature ( paul davies - macquarie uni - sydney , australia - emergent biological principle and the computational resource of the universe , complexity vol 10( 2 ) , p1 "
so basically ultra complex system can produce wierd outcome ; such as rock , intelligent life or high temperature superconductors all from the same raw material - simply arrange slightly differentally . this might bring down the number of universe require to create life from infinite to merely fairly large !
can we please get these people a voice in washington ?
how long be we suppose to wait to see if this womans brain will ever rewire effectively before we move on ?
we americans have let our victim fetish get so bad that we be pathetic .
if i be in az @-@ 08 , i think this would be a fair question but i 'm not sure of what the mechanism to remove a congresswoman be other than the ballot box .
strom thurmond be not all there but still hold his office with the consent of his constituent .
i think as long as her constituent be ok with it , we do n't get a say .
as butrflynet point out , gabrielle gifford 's office be do quite a lot .
that do n't seem incidental or trivial to me .
gabrielle giffords be vote in because people agree with her policy and approach to politics .
she hand @-@ select this group of people who now make up her office , with the intent of work together to implement her vision .
in that way , she be still the representative , as these people take her state vision and priority and work to make them happen .
if giffords be unable to recover fully before the next election , i think it would make sense that her second @-@ in @-@ command , or whomever have be most instrumental in the work that her office have be do since the injury , go ahead and run in her place .
i think engineer 's point about not encourage removal from office by gunshot be a good one .
the member of the minority party in the house of representative be largely cipher anyway , although only a few of them have the excuse that they suffer from medically certifiable brain damage .
all the democrat in the house could take a year @-@ long vacation and the result would largely be the same , so giffords 's absence from her duty be hardly consequential .
indeed , the country would benefit if more congressmen could be induce to take extended break from their duty .
it might be a good idea to keep track of this woman . some basics from her wiki biography might be helpful .
the congresswoman , who be about to turn 55 , be born in iowa . when her parent divorce , she move to minnesota with her mother . she work in a kibbutz after high school , attend winona state university , the now defunct law school at oral roberts university and the william and mary law school where she take a master 's degree in tax law .
she have be marry for 30 year . " bachmann and her husband own a christian counseling clinic in stillwater , minnesota .
bachmann also have an ownership stake in waumandee , wisconsin farm land . since the death of her father @-@ in @-@ law , the farm and its building have be rent out to a neighboring farmer who maintain a dairy herd on the farm . from 1995 through 2006 , the tenant @-@ farmer receive $ 251,973 in federal subsidy , chiefly for dairy and corn price support ."
initially a democrat , she become disillusion with jimmy carter . in 1976 , the christian documentary by francis schaeffer , " how should we then live ? " impel her to take up an anti @-@ abortion stance and she and her fiance begin pray outside abortion facility .
" in 1993 , bachmann and other parent start a k @-@ 12 charter school in stillwater , and she begin speak against a state @-@ mandate set of educational standard , which propel her into the world of politics .
bachmann become an outspoken critic and opponent of minnesota 's school @-@ to @-@ work policy . in a 1999 column , she write : " school @-@ to @-@ work alter the basic mission and purpose of k @-@ 12 academic education away from traditional broad @-@ based academic study gear toward maximize intellectual achievement of the individual . instead , school @-@ to @-@ work utilize the school day to promote children 's acquisition of workplace skill , view children as trainee for increase economic productivity."*
* my reaction : what a surprise .
i love michele bachmann !
with any luck , she will be the republican nominee for the 2012 presidential race .
a dream opponent for the dems , really .
now , if her run mate be to be someone name turner , the dems could be in trouble , like , a bachmann @-@ turner ticket would blow them off the road once the campaign get into overdrive .
doubt if she 'd adopt an anti @-@ vocational ed stance , though .
all i know , be the more i see her on television , the better .
youtube : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=iaadvod2srq
@33export ,
i 'm not certain that everyone will " get " the reference to bachmann @-@ turner . the canadians , however , will .
@plainoldme ,
it make me laugh ( and i be american ) .
thats only because you aint see nothing yet .
@maxdancona ,
my comment be simply a reply to the backhanded reference to bto .
imho , michele bachmann be not as sharp as a bowl ball and have no business even think about run for president .
i love watch michele bachmann . she be funnier than any sitcom on television . bad thing be she make mitt ronmey look very solid . i mean , compare to palin and bachmann , romney sound like einstein lol .
@jcboy ,
i believe that bachmann have a real chance of beat romney for the nomination . i think it will come down to the two of them , and romney 's negative , from be a mormon to have take so many position in the past that annoy conservative .

as amusing as a bachmann candidacy would be , itll never happen . there be some intelligent people in the rnc who realize that this would be tantamount to hand over the presidential race to obama without fire a shot . the rnc be scare that the public may love her like they do sarah.with the gop try to find its " center of mass " they be p[arading out these clown that can only cause them big trouble in november 2012
it 's that time again .
politician run for mid @-@ term election be attack their opponent and in do so , stretch truth where ever they may be find .
i want to get a list of fact check websites go .
it 'd be interesting to see if different site come up with the same facts....
i figure someone should just start a website call they all lie dot com and just post pics of all the candidate , that would certainly make it easier
i 'm kind of cynical that fact even matter anymore .
we 've leave the information age , we be well into the opinion age .
that idiotic gop " pledge to america " be rip to shred by factcheck.org , but it won't matter because those who believe it ( or at least believe in the idea of it ) won't ever dare venture near a fact check source .
i think we need a new web service that fact check , but also track who come and read the fact .
you must have be read the pledge to america , in which the gop promise to return the country to fail bush policy of borrow and spend and the elimination of oversight and regulation .
it be his policy that bring us a net job loss over ten year ( first in history ) , bank that become , in essence , hedge fund , sleazy sub @-@ prime mortgage loan , torture , corruption , etc.
moreover , privatizing social security and medicare be a prescription for disaster .
( check with the brits who go through this relative to their version of social security.)
while the hostility between internal faction of the clerical regime and their feud over the sham election be escalate , the people of tehran , particularly young people , demonstrate in their thousand in different part of the city include fatemi street , vali @-@ asr street and square , vanak square , shariati street , takht @-@ e @-@ tavoos street and sa'adatabad against the illegitimate and fraudulent election .
whereas i take every single word utter by israel with a grain of salt the size of jupiter , even i can smell the stink from that election .
dear fellow american , this 4 th of july , while you and your family celebrate the 230 th anniversary of the found of our great nation , there 's one party you won't be invite to...
...and that 's the party that kofi annan be throw at unite nation headquarters in new york -- use your tax dollar -- for nearly fifty dictatorship , six terrorist state , government that endorse execution based on religious faith , and a multitude of other nation from around the globe .
you see , this party be n't to honor your freedom -- but to conspire to take them away .
over our july 4 th holiday , on american soil , they be prepare to enact a legally @-@ bind treaty that would give the u.n. unchallengeable power to ban civilian ownership of all firearm .
that mean your rifle , your shotgun and your handgun . and your freedom !
to learn what you can do to stop the u.n .' s global gun ban treaty @-@ before it destroy our second amendment right to keep and bear arm visit www.stopungunban.org .
just as a handful of patriot fire the " shot hear ' round the world " at concord bridge , it 's up to you and me and every patriot who cherish our bill of right to tell the world today that our nation will not be bully by the u.n.
thank you for act today .
throw ' em out , and drop out .
this organization have be finance with u.s. tax dollar since its inception , and all it do it fee off of the money and try to kill the host . f--- ' em .
odd , such an extensive website about the threat of this global gun ban treaty , a dozen webpages at least -- and it doesnt actually seem to have a single link to the actual text of say propose ban .
do n't those nra member want to check out for themselves what the text actually say ?
do n't you think it 's odd ?
do n't you want to know what that ban treaty actually say ?
the treaty can be find here..
it seem that lapierre be in support of criminal based on the what this treaty do .
try read the un treaty when you sober up cj..
you might find it be n't even close to what you desperately want to think it be .
what make you think the nra let little fact like that get in the way of stir up fear ?
like the un be go to actually demand that we close our firearm factory , and they be just go to lock the door because of this treaty .
lethal injection electric chair gas chamber hang fire sqaud
who care , would you rather have your hard earn tax dollar spend by keep them behind bar .
i would n't .
lethal injection follow by hang .
fire squad be probably pretty quick , but i do n't know that it 's use much .
the electric chair and gas chamber be nothing short of barbaric .
on the ballet i fill out yesterday , there be a constitution party run for president .
i try to look up their website , but it be block at work .
so this even peak my curiousity even more ( as the other candidate websites be not block ) .
anyone have a clue ?
here be their mission statement .
interest - i have n't hear of them before and be curious .
what could have be so offensive that the website be block ?
obama 's view that affirmative action should , after these many year , continue may lead to his defeat in november .
and this may be the correct result .
affirmative action equate to discrimination against nonbeneficiaries , usually while male . obama say he be against quota , but so @-@ call goal be invariable set up .
moreover , the goal be a euphemism for quota .
obama should assidiously avoid the aa term and instead embrace programs the benefit the economically disadvantaged , regardless of race , gender , or ethnic origin .
depends on how it 's frame .
by far , the largest group benefit from affirmative action is.... wait for it..... white women .
affirmative action have be essential in allow women to break into some high pay , male dominate field .
many of these field be clearly still male dominate in the management area .
all obama have to do it make the point , repeatedly , that mccain 's position be anti @-@ women and he be for increase the role women play in the workplace and he 's get a winner .
what be tell be that even when talk about obama 's " defeat " the other guy never get mention .
if this prediction be true i would think one would consider it what 's his name 's " victory " rather than obama 's defeat .
they can n't both lose...
the funny thing be that more americans support affirmative action than oppose it ( this gallup poll show 49 @-@ 43 in favor of aa for racial minority ) .
the conservative do n't understand that turn the majority of americans into " liberal " be not a good electoral strategy ( as they see in the 2006 election and will see again in november ) .
i 'm always surprise to see affirmative action discuss in term of liberal/conservative .
my brother , who be a general in the us army , self identify as conservative but be a big believer in affirmative action .
i self identify as a moderate liberal and definately identify as a woman am not nearly the supporter he be .
so i 'm just go to read along to see if the why of this be a liberal v . conservative issue become any clearer......
quota be racist .
there be no get around it .
they be a mean of make a choice based on race .
why do it surprise anyone that obama would support quota ?
obama be n't against all racism , just some of it .
are those who question 9 @/@ 11 anti @-@ semites ?
anti @-@ semitism be one of the most frequent allegation levy by defender of the government 's version of 9 @/@ 11 against people question that account .
be it true ?
are 9 @/@ 11 activist really anti @-@ semites ?
not anti @-@ semites .
just anti @-@ logical
so out of the 70 million american voter who say we need new 911 investigation there be no jews ?
not likely .
this post be based on the incorrect statement that :
" anti @-@ semitism be one of the most frequent allegation levy by defender of the government 's version of 9 @/@ 11 against people question that account ."
no. anti @-@ semitism be not the most frequent accusation against those that question the government explanation of 9 @/@ 11 .
only when obvious anti @-@ semites try to say " the jews do it , " might that allegation make .
and , that i think be a version of 9 @/@ 11 that be accept in many muslim country as the most popular notion .
unfortunately , anti @-@ zionism and anti @-@ semitism have be meld in the popular culture by many people .
so , anti @-@ zionists often become anti @-@ semites , rather than do the intellectual effort to parse the two concept .
i see clinton on a show this weekend .
when ask why no economist support her tax holiday plan , she say they be elitist who do n't understand the pain the common man be in .
just to review , clinton and mccain have propose eliminate the federal gas tax of $ 0.18/gallon during the summer drive season .
mccain say he will pay for it with spend reduction , clinton with tax on oil company .
obama ( and all economist ) say this be a bad idea and result in insignificant savings .
there be no support for this in congress and the president have denounce it .
if the tax be repeal , several commentator feel the refiner will take some for themselves since they have also be hurt by rise price .
what burn me be the " elitist " comment apply to economist .
we tell our children to work hard , get a good education and become expert in their field , but if they disagree with a politician , they become latte drink elitist out of touch with the hard work common man .
be n't this just what bush have do to the scientific community in miniture ?
be n't advice from expert require to run a country like the us ?
i 'm sure there be some economist of priviledge out there as well as some who propose solution based on theory without regard to the impact of their idea , but clinton do n't have any economist who support her proposal , so what 's the deal ?
( i do n't know about mccain 's belief since clinton have be do the heavy lift so far.)
interest i think , be the poll release this morning on msnbc detail that 45 % think the gas tax holiday be a good thing while 49 % think it 's bad .
whatever , i think it 's just plain sleazy .
engineer engineer , i repeat my response on another of your topic .
i agree with you and dyslexia .
hillary clinton 's desperation " gas vacation " proposal be about the last straw with me .
she have really demean herself as far as i 'm concern .
it 's not only her pander , it 's that the proposal be so stupid .
the oil company would end up with the money by raise their price and the public would get nothing .
hillary clinton for senate majority leader be now my choice for her . bbb
clinton and mccain be try to win vote with nickle and dime stuff ;
our economy be strain so badly , it need more than $ 600 tax rebate or one @-@ time summer relief from tax ;
it 's call a ) save home of million of family , b ) our economy , and c ) the war in iraq and afghanistan .
some dunderhead will fall for these gimmick , and vote for them in november .
i have go thru countless election and many thing be say in the heat of the campaign .
hillary once elect might go not thru with it .
that be not to say she lie but that wiser head may counsel her to pass it up .
where be dick cheney ?
why have he desert ?
his absence have be explain many time in many different way , but he have virtually disappear from the scene .
this would n't be so important , but he still be the vice president , be n't he ?
thing be look very muddled right now .
rumsfeld , who be enjoy a limelight , be now be ask to keep a low profile , since his abrasive personality have alienate so many .
poor bush , no matter how many time they parade him , still be n't impressive .
and powell be begin to look like a desperate man in search of some dignity .
a lot of public appearance be leave to ari fleischer , which be his job , but he do n't exactly have such an ingratiate personality either .
which do n't leave us very much in the way of impressive @-@ look leadership .
so where be cheney ?
he 's in the underground command center....
he 'll resurface soon...
maybe he be in a cryogenic chamber right next to ted williams .
in other word they be keep him on ice .
moonlight for haliburton
weird , be n't it .
i 've be wonder where he wander off to .
he 's be ' off the radar ' for a long time .
but he tell us all at the outset that this be the way it would be .
he be spend time in the bowel of hell with his real boss , plot and plan .
yes and get rich by the day .
maybe a low profile because his name be now show up in arabic and european paper regard that very same halliburton bit ?
as reagan would say here we go again .
k @-@ mart be close 326 store and lay off approximately 35,000 people .
it be almost a daily ritual with the announcement of massive layoff .
president bush on the other hand continue to claim the economy be strong , not as strong as it could be but strong nonetheless .
he have however present a package which he contend will stimulate the economy and create job .
over half of the package $ 367 billion will come by remove the tax on dividend .
what do you think of the package will it stimulate the economy ?
in addition if the economy remain sluggish what be bush 's chance for re @-@ election ?
yeah , it 'll stimulate the top ten percent of the wealthy in this country , but will do nothing for our economy .
money must be put into the hand of the middle class and the poor for our economy to be stimulate .
the best way to accomplish that be to cut everybody 's tax by ten percent effective january 1 , 2003 .
that 'll pump about a half trillion dollar into our economy . c.i .
well , i think it would be nice to see that title somewhere...since i can n't find it in reality....
it be wild to me how such an effective , strong , woman -- the closest advisor to the most powerful person in the world -- have garner no more support , no accolade from women and black -- two group who be always try to find successful sister or positive story of black achievement .
i have notice a distinct discrimination among women and black in whom they will ballyhoo , and whom they won't .
if any other woman in this country have soar to the height condi have reach , it would be mardi gras 24 @/@ 7...
clarence thomas be unwelcomed among his own race .
the second black person to serve on the scotus .
even if he have a disfigure pigment problem and a third leg , if he be the slightest bit liberal -- he 'd have statue and street name after him already .
i hear a georgia mayor on npr today , and be hearten .
he be explain to the ( of course , liberal ) quizzical reporter how he could be a republican .
it be as if he have to apologize to the entire black community...
i be proud that he tell the reporter he feel racially stereotype to be expect to be a democrat .
he should n't be expect to be anything .
it be to the great , abide shame of women and black to turn their back on the great achievement of these people .
it be the new racism ; by black against black .
the new feminist sexism . appal .
some liberal do n't much cotton to " uppity " black like powell , thomas and rice confront racial discrimination and outright racism and leave the plantation of dependency on white liberal and achieve the great thing they be capable of .
gotta ' keep ' em in their place , you know .
what do women or black have to do with it .
clinton have a women secretary of state , and rice do not represent black , so what be your beef ?
what amuse me about rice be that she live in the south during the civil right movement , and that experience seem to have leave her untouched .
yet bush mention that background as though she actually do anything beyond strive toward her own growth .
more power to her for her achievement .
but do n't be surprise if you 're not hear wild applause from her community , because i 'm not sure she have one...
assume she establish a credible name for herself as secretary of state , i be cautiously anticipate the gop nominee in 2008 to be condoleeza rice .
and yes , i think she can be elect easily assume that the gop be allow something close to a level play field .
i think colin powell against gore or kerry in the last two election would have win by a landslide .
americans , especially republican americans , have largely leave issue of racism and @/@ or stereotypical prejudice and bigotry well behind them .
any qualify person with charisma and a track record can compete with clout .
i keep hear that inflation be under control .
and i suppose it be if one do not need to put food on the table , buy gasoline , heat oil , electricity and many of the necessity of life .
from your prospective do you find inflation to be a non @-@ factor ?
did n't seem to have much effect on the last couple of yacht i buy .
now , i hear that high end house ( 1 1 @/@ 2 million +) be also hold the line in some area .
this whole economy seem to be based on the comfort level of the one referred to by dubya as his base .
lock up all scumbags .
lock 'm up .
make 'm work .
break up the gang .
if you get catch with meth , get to jail...
there be no unfortunate case .
you have dope its illegal , you know it be illegal before you have the dope .
and to whomever spoke of the innocence in prison , quit talk like that be the norm .
99.9 %of inmate deserve to be there .
i will take those odds in vegas any day .
please pick bloomberg to be your vicepresident .
please read this if you do n't instantly see why... http : //www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1632736,00.html
he would ensure that moderate , libertarian , and technocrat sick of politics as usual would vote for you .
he be easily among the most competent politician we have .
he research and practice evidence based politics and thus virtually every policy he seek no matter how unpopular proved a success .
and he like you know how to balance budget without hurt the economy .
he can also pay for the election campaign .
i highly doubt that bloomberg be go to switch party .
he 's already an independent ( switch from republican ) .
but , offset hillary 's " northeastern elite " and " inexperienced " negative with bloomberg 's " northeastern elite " and " inexperienced " negative ? not so much .
personally i look upon this conflict as the source of 90 % of western @-@ muslim 's confrontation ,
the us need and so support israel , israel want to stop attack on its citizen and so strike on palestinian target , which in turn result in more attack on israel , this increase the number of radical muslims too , which result in attack against america around the world( military target , embassy , and citizen ) result in american foriegn policy like the war on iraq and @/@ or afghanistan , and the circle continue , reaction to action result in reaction , this circle have no begin and no end
be not easy to solve , but if we try to and start by the issue at core( palestinian @-@ israeli conflict ) the rest can be handle ,
i want to start a thread here , that simulate peace negotiation between two side , palestinians ( me and who ever volunteer ) against israeli side ( i suppose volunteer wouldnot mind represent them and any one he choose )
each side be allow one post per day , then after every two post its discuss freely by all for two day , then each side make a post , as the palestinian side be the one with most demand let let them start( if its ok by all ) ,
i need ur ok guy and girl .
very true , the same people who say saddam violate un resolution , seem to forget , israel have be in violation of un resolution for decade .
give up hell , tell them to come get it ?
that go for isreal too , if egypt or syria be anything worthwhile , isreal would n't of get what they do .
to the victor go the spoil .
glad i 've never back the un .
israel be western , civilize , the progenitor of the first christian community , and face total annihilation every day of its life , thank to be surround by psycopathic state .
therefore.......we must back it . :headbang :
so you think if isreal stop retaliate , the attack would stop ?
no chance of that , they would chip at them untill they be extinct .
max blumenthal go to the young republican convention in dc , and ask why none of them - who strongly support the wot and the war in iraq - have bother to sign up and serve in the arm force .
unsurprisingly , there be plenty of excuse band about .
republican get mad when the ' chickenhawk ' argument be bring up , and this be because it be damn effective .
they usually attempt to counter with some version of this line :
it be n't stupid , though .
there be a perceivable and significant differnce between those who discuss war , who think it be sometimes necessary , and who be willing to do what must be do for us safety ; and the war cheerleader .
the actively aggressive advocate of warfare as a solution to life 's problem .
those be the chickenhawks : the one who continually advocate the solve of our national foreign policy problem use arm force .
the one who suggest that the us be so strong , we can go it alone if we have to and we should n't be hold back from attack other country by little thing like , say , international convention .
they advocate use maximum force to win ; their problem with the war in iraq be that we be n't kill enough people over there , innocent include .
these people , who cheer on the death of others , who think that force be the best way to get what we want - but do n't sign up to serve themselves - be chickenhawks .
they be too cowardly to put their ass on the line , but continually advocate that others do so .
this topic be right on the money .
these leech and vulture be the one get rich off of the nation 's blood .
they stand safely back , say , " let 's you and them fight .
me ? i 'll cheer you on , while me and my friend get rich off your effort ."
there be a time when i strongly support the invasion of iraq , and it have nothing to do with present the good people of iraq with a democratic form of government .
oh , i also spend 5 year in the us army , from a time when most of us have hear of indochina , through the period when just everybody could name each country in the region .
so , i 'm an oddball . s'okay .
yes , i would imagiane that patrick daniel tillman most likely did n't need the $ when he enlist but it be curious why bush render the investigation of his death as a secret of national security .
the chinese be go to stab us in the back . if we do n't turn away from iraq and afghanistan to rebuild @/@ recover our strength . where they 're financially and militarily , bleed us to death .
fine , threaten to sell aegis equip ship to taiwan if they do so .
if china be to do that , they would be cut their own throat .
the last thing that china want be a weak dollar because that would completely wipe out any chance of a trade surplus from their number one trade partner... the u.s.
a weak dollar mean lot and lot of close down factory in china because the americans can n't afford their widgets and doohickies .
they will threaten , they will try to influence , but they won't ' drop the bomb ' unless they have a guarantee of some other country willing to buy several hundred billion dollar worth of junk a year .
what do you think the consequence would be ?
do you think the shrub could pull it off ?
if not , why ?
his approval rate cannot sink , so , what 's the risk .
after all , he 's the decider , and congress hold his trousers while he skinny dip .
do america want us to lose this war and cut and run as reid and pelosi have impose upon our president ?
do america want us to have to fight our way back in in six month or a year with a death toll in multiple of thousand over a radically less period of time ?
also if we pull out of iraq and go into darfur what will be the justification for join that war , wmd ?
reid and pelosi tell the government not to fight america 's war be like congress and the senate tell the government not to fight racism and the kkk a few decade back .
these cowardly democrat be bargain that americans will be stupid and not realize the deep war that will have to be re @-@ fought in only a few short year .
iran and russia will be the next war along with chavez if we do not create a successful democracy in iraq .
the power vacuum will in iraq pull iran and russia and possibly the whole middle east and maybe even china into an allied front against america .
this my friend be armageddon .
reid and pelosi have be tell this i be sure but they simply do n't care .
win election trump all other concerns...
do we really want these people set public policy ?
why not leave and let the iraqis fight the war ?
answer : if the most powerful army be already struggle in this war what will it be like when we pull out and come back in six month to a year ?
reid and pelosi stop try to shove your partisan politics at our president over the general " sound " military policy .
listen to your bribe bibber murtha instead of our generals...
seven friggin ' year of this crap be enough ! !!
if we pull out now the disaster will be on your head just in time for election...
the blood of freedom be at stake and the very people who claim to value it be now our own worst enemy .
the new democratic kkk sell our freedom and dignity simply for power .
do america look to genius such as yourself for analysis ?
. now i know you be just kid , that attitude be just whacky otherwise .
there be ton of example in history of ill advise " proactive " war , and most of these be eventually lose by the aggressor
also , rex , try to be civilize and dont resort to childish name call .
its usually a sign of an inability to craft an argument solely based upon the issue at hand .
just because you feel passionately about this doesnt automatically mean that others will embrace your opinion .
oh yeh , and , if you call me a coward again , ill come up there to jonesport , hunt you down , and buy you a drink first .
i 'm think farmerman mean what he say .
the day it become truly cowardly of one to suggest an end to mindless mayhem be the day i want to float off this planet .
edgar , you know its a cynical attempt at " spin " by the rapidly sink ss bush .
his " handler " be try to cover ytracks and leave a legacy that be goona leve his presidency up there with harding or buchanan .
( oy , theres a comparison , buchanan , i believe start the first of the ' proactive war " against the mormons ) ,
people like you have do more to screw this country up than " the democrat " could ever have hope to do .
you repeatedly vote for and support a president and an administration who be clearly and obviously incompetent and ideologically extreme .
this be evident from campaign through the early year of governance .
you think that america mean red , white , and blue and war and think nothing of shred the constitution on the way to more blood and glory .
and you dare to presume that you be somehow the " real americans " and the rest of us , those of us who actually know what the constitution say and know what this ignoramus be try to do to it , be somehow go to destroy " your " country .
you wave your flag and trust an ignorant incompetent who can n't even run this country to somehow rebuild another , one that he do n't even begin to understand and have never be to .
you trust an idiot .
you think the answer to incompetence and mismanagement be faith .
you and your brethren , the bush die @-@ hards , have send this country in a death spiral .
and sadly , the only people we can have any hope of pull us out be the " other party ".
a party that already be wane in respect due to corruption and its willingness to take some fundamental social justice concept too far be now support by a majority of the public , and the beloved party of small government and individual liberty be now a hulking rusty heap of corruption , scandal , incompetence , special interest , big government , and domestic spy .
maybe i be , and maybe i 'm say that you 're an idiot .
hard to say exactly . :wink :
you mean scut farkas and his sidekick " toady " be grover dill , who be actually beat up by delbert bumpus .
i need to set these thing correct so that the record will be clear testimonyat rex 's sanity hear .
i be a conservative , and you be an idiot .
you said..
most christions i know will not bow to another god , no matter who that god be .
thats why so many christians be kill by the ancient romans , they refuse to bow down .
also , to use an old cliche..." i would rather die on my feet then live on my knee "
i be read in the paper today about all the law under consideration that would make it harder for americans to vote when i suddenly flash on all the purple finger iraqi voter that be so celebrate in our press only a few short year ago .
i think i must be miss something because i 'm really confuse by this .
why would any state do anything that would make it harder for it 's citizen to vote ?
please can someone explain this to me ?
that 's pretty easy .
conseratives figure ( and probably with justification ) that their voter base will get out and vote without regard for any minor hurdle which might be throw in their way .
they rely on older citizen and more affluent citizen .
anything which make vote more difficult they figure will reduce the number of voter go to the poll to vote for democrat .
i do n't have a problem with the first two - provide that they make available photo ids at no cost to people with limited income and allow clear instruction and make it easy to obtain ( in other word - there be many location to obtain and enough hour that be vary enough to get these ids ) .
i support have ids to limit voter fraud , but you cannot make it difficult and it should be economically feasible for all to get an id .
i mean if you make the extra effort to go out and vote - it should n't be much more a burden to get an id .
the democrat must return to their progressive program , and must spend the resource necessary to remind the people that the gop , the right wing , the tea party be just plain wrong on the issue .
hopefully the massachusetts loss have make obama go back on the progressive track .
what be interesting about the 2 party system be the people never actually vote for a party .
they always vote against the other one .
the net result be the people be misrepresent 100 % of the time - but amazingly they be so dumb they can n't figure it out .
we ask you : to save money , should local government use nonviolent inmate for physical labor ?
that be the question in the other day 's opinion section of my my local newspaper .
yes : 92.6 % no : 7.4 %
so my qestion be this , should gov't turn to slave to save money ?
@david cv , depending on country it be already do .
hard labour , chaingangs , prison farm voluntary work while incarcerate get minimal pay etc
the option as voluntary will at least not require quota and enforcement through violent means( beating ) or witholding of priveledges like food , bedding( yes bed ) or outdoor sunlight and isolation.( legislativ brutality encouragement )
the question be what kind of work be beneficial in a crime and punishment relate way .
some experiements be already implement in disaster relief bushfires/floods , comunity work as replacement for incarceration.( anti social behaviour treatment )
it really depends on the moral standard of the nation in question .
force labour in europe compare to africa or america be implement differently
have'nt goverments @/@ corporation turn their populus trough a monetary reward @/@ tax system into work slave anyway ?
what 's your thought on this ?
i mean , the guy be 88 year old .
be it really necessary after all these year ?
he 's be here since 1955 and never do a thing to any one .
be a nazi be what be expect of germans back then .
you and i , have we live there during that time , would probably have be in the same boat .
the head of the osi be name rosenbaum , what do you expect ?
while i disagree with you that we 'd all be nazis , it be over 60 year ago , and the man have obviously reform .
expel him be a political move to strengthen the zionist stance through a reminder of the holocaust , and serve as a talk point for the anti @-@ ahmadinejad crowd .
so i be discuss that new tv show on abc , commander in chief , with my grandfather .
he make a comment that be interest , he say , " that show be just the liberal media try to get us use to the idea of a woman president for when hillary run ."
now , my grandfather be one of those old , cynical guy that think that every sport game that do n't go his way be fix , and be a tad racest , however , i find the statement intrigueing and make me wonder .
what be your guy ' opinion ?
i 've definitely hear that argument before , and i refuse to watch the dang show .
ok so i live in mi and maryjane be just legalize in our state .
well all know why a state would legalize it , but do you really think that it can help somebody ? if so why ?
think of any other drug that you feel may help someone .
think of this . when i be do crystal , i be in school .
i never miss a day of school .
when i go to my class tweak , i pay more attention to what be go on in class .
i go home do all of my homework .
i remember lookin at one of my report card before i start use and my grade be either all d 's or d 's and f 's .
then i look at a report card that i get that have all a 's on it .
i be soo high on crystal that semester that i do not even remember most what happen at school or at home .
so i ask do you think drug can be good for some people ?
i know that no matter what no drug be good for anyone .
this do n't mean that i would go back and change thing if i could , because i really do not want to .
i be just wonder how other people feel about this .
@secondchance , i think that drug can have positive but i think that they 'll rarely come without negative and whether or not it 's a net positive be hard for anyone to tell , most of all the user .
@secondchance , it be possible to self medicate to a positive outcome . responsible use be require .
for instance a couple of generation of artist have widely use drug , convince that the change in consciousness be of great help to their work .
we modern have no doubt but that it be a good idea to drug people up on ritalin and anti anxiety drug and antidepressants , this highly drug society have no basis to complain about wee and coke .
meth though mess people up big time , so i do n't see a lot of upside to that .
yes , and i 'm one of them .
my life would be impoverish without my daily glass of wine .
i quite enjoy the few joint i have try .
and sometime , when i 'm in a better general mood than i be right now , i 'd like to try lsd or one of its relative , maybe magic mushroom .
to me , consume drug be a matter of moderation , not abstinence .
my wife have constant ring in her ear : noise , a " whooshing " as she describe .
any idea ? thank
@robc , that 's tinnitus .
she should see an otorhinolaryngologist ( ear specialist ; ear , nose and throat specialist ) as , if this be recent , there may be thing they can do .
i just watch the most fascinate , inspire , and yet heartbreaking documentary : the half ton man .
obesity be reach epidemic proportion in the world today .
be there a fat gene ?
science seem to think there be .
many people feel hungry every minute they be awake and fight the fact they know they be literally kill themselves with every bite they take .
one man in the documentary lost 706 pound !
yet , when he reach 198 pound he celebrate by have a hot dog , which turn into two , three , etc.
he now be morbidly obese again and be n't ready to go back into rehab at a center that have great success in help these people .
when i be younger i could eat virtually anything and not gain weight .
i 'm almost 52 and it 's not quite that easy for me to keep my weight to what be comfortable for me .
i be able to do it , but watch this video scare me . one woman in the video be actually eight feet wide when she get help .
i have see show on tv where two year old children weigh nearly 200 pound all because their parent want to appease the child and stop their fuss .
do anyone out there have a big problem with their weight ?
how do you combat it ?
be food an addiction ?
be over @-@ eat a disease like drug addiction or alcoholism ?
now , that 's a link ! lol
i think the problem and cure be psychological . they should spend more time on the psycology of it couple with the surgery .
oh , now there get into that part .
i watch that documentary on patrick deuel a while back....too bad he 's gain some weight back .
but there 's always hope he 'll get back on track .
besides the obvious medical issue with him , i be disturb by the co @-@ dependant relationship with his wife .
at his worst , he weigh 1,072 pound .
he be unable to even roll over in bed , let alone get to the refrigerator or supermarket....
he could n't even get to a phone or a computer to order food if you put it 10 feet away from him .
so....who be feed his all that crap ?
who be bring it to him ?
she feel she 's show love by bring him to death door because he ask for ( or begged or rant ) for food .
and not just food....garbage .
i understand love for your spouse , but theirs be not a healthy relationship .
also , in the video , after he have get under 500 pound , patrick say " i avoid food with a lot of fat and sodium "....as he be snack on individual size bag on salt nut and potato chip .
in the scene before that ( after his gastic bypass and much weight loss ) , the wife bring him dinner....kentucky fry chicken .
" oh ", she say , " here 's your protein ", as she wave an extra crispy drumstick at him .
my husband love egg sald .
when i make it , i through out 4 out of the 12 yolk , and mix in a pound of tofu....he never know the difference .
( btw , he 's very thin , but have a heart condition ) .
wifey could maybe take some lesson from me .
doctor have tell me i have a full thickness rotator cuff tear and must have surgery or my shoulder will freeze .
look for information from anyone who have have it or with someone recuperate .
i have hear the recovery be brutally painful .
any tip , suggestion , etc. , about what to expect during first few day , how to manage , sleep , any info .
i have it do three year ago at john hopkins .
i have suffer low grade " bursitis " in one shoulder for many year ( probably a worn rotator cuff ) , until one day while work out i get a real , full tear .
lot of serious pain with some movement or any strenuous exertion .
my surgery be successful , but it take me several month to regain my range of motion in the shoulder .
i learn that the post op therapy be probably more critical than the surgery itself .
i be determine to restore the range of motion and to return to my old exercise routine , so i in effect take charge of the rehab program and make it clear to the therapist the orthopedic surgeon that i would n't accept less .
in retrospect i believe this be the critical thing , in that the docs . and the therapist take their cue from the patient -- if you passively accept less than full recovery , they will let you go .
if you be determine to go on , they will help .
i have full use of the shoulder and no more pain .
i would do it again .
i hope this be helpful and wish you good luck !
i 'm under erratic , severe stress in my personal life and my colorful , efficient adrenalin gland be play merry hell with my blood pressure .
i 'm hope to avoid drug by lose weight and learn serenity , but meanwhile i 'm suppose to monitor my blood pressure at home .
once upon a time i have a jim @-@ dandy wrist unit that work perfectly .
then after 7 year of faithful service , it up and die .
now the wrist unit at the local drugstore come with a read @-@ outbox that be too wide for my 5 1 @/@ 2 inch wrist .
i 've also try the wrap @-@ the @-@ upper arm monitor .
these only work about 20 % of the time and deal with them send my blood pressure up to new height .
also , because of a lumpectomy i can only use my left arm for b.p. reading .
i 'm leave hand , but be make progress in non @-@ dominent @-@ hand dexterity .
can anyone recommend a no @-@ hassle , luddite @-@ friendly home blood pressure monitor that will work around bird bone ?
noddy , from your post i assume you have not check on the model currently on the market .
most company have fully automatic model that do n't require adjust it to your arm with every use .
you adjust it once to fit your arm ( you can do this with it off your arm ; it might take two try ) and that 's that .
slip it on your arm . press a button and in less than a minute read your b.p. and heart rate .
i 've have an omron for three year and have never have a problem .
i think it cost in the vicinity of $ 50-$ 60 .
you can get them a bit cheap if you be willing to pump it up yourself .
the semi @-@ automatic that i have do the pump for you .
as i sit here foggy head and let face it with most of the symptom of hypoglycemia i think i should do something about it .
im try to start to eat healthily , slowly but surely , which mean cut out process food and eat more natural thing .
a good start to begin with but not necessarily deal with hypoglycemia .
it say give up thing like caffiene , tobacco , thing i dont consume anyway , it say give up wheat , which be bread , which i tend to eat alot of .
i assume we all do , it kind of house all the other ingredient we need like in sandwich or wrap , pizza .
basically do anybody have any advice on what to eat or recomend a good book ?
search out a glycemia index , and determine something both edible and low on the list .
add that to your diet , to avoid get into hypoglycemia .
if it happen anyway , skim ( non fat ) milk will raise the blood sugar about as fast as anything .
indulge in a light bedtime snack , again , something fairly low on the list .
do n't overdo it , though .
i have not yet be diagnose but i be begin to suspect hypoglycemia @/@ low blood sugar .
lately i have be very confuse , have anxiety , dizziness , fatigue , weak , depress , and generally low .
i know i need to gain more weight - i lose about 20 pound suddenly about 6 month ago and have n't be able to gain it back .
how do a doctor diagnose someone with this ?
what test should i have them run ?
i have be read about flumist , the new flu vaccine that be administer intranasally .
one thing that i notice , be that it be market as suitable for people age 5 @-@ 49 .
i have not see any material as to why the 50+ population be unsuitable for this vaccine .
anybody know why ?
well , accord to that fda link children between 5 and 17 be the most likely to actually get the flu itself and it look like that be the intend target age group for the development of flumist .
they note that it be 87 % effective in prevent people in that range from get the flu at all but people in the 18 @-@ 49 range only have lessen symptom .
it seem the older the patient the less effective the drug .
it be inconceivable that you take a multivitamin in good faith and it wreck havoc on your health in such a profound way but that be the case .
i " be " take a centrum multivitamin once a day as suggest on the back label and i be wake up with dry mouth so sever i could not even swallow .
my skin be get scaly , my eye burn and my feet be so dry they begin to develop callus and crack .
i stop my vitamin and it be now go .
what be up centrum ?
it be not just centrum but any type of multivitamin cause this .
if you search the internet for " dry mouth and multivitamin " you get this idiot name " jade m " on google answer that reply that it be " not likely " that a multivitamin be cause this dryness of nearly every cell in the body .
sorry to say jade m whoever you be but you be wrong...
if you do n't know what you be talk about you should n't be doling out incorrect information in an online medical forum .
my sister be a nurse at a veteran hospital and she complain to her doctor that she be get dry mouth .
he tell her that it be her multivitamin and she cut down her intake of the multivitamin and her dry mouth left completely .
a friend of mine who take many medication for his heart just come up to me and tell me he be get terrible dry mouth at night and reduce his multivitamin to only a few time a week and now no more dry mouth .
in other word if you follow the direction on the back label of your vitamin they will start slowly kill you .
do n't expect paul g. donohue m.d.to help you either .
he basically dismiss this elderly person claim then try to get her to take corrective medication .
how typical...
i get dry mouth too plus my skin get dry and scaly and when i stop my multivitamin it immediately go away .
now this be four completely unrelated people all come to the exact same conclusion .
not only can we not trust the general consensus on the internet but we cannot trust people who have phd credentials give their advice online .
what do we have to dry up and die before we finally figure out what ail us ?
when my sister tell this to me i do not really give it much think .
then i permanently lose 10 % of my eyesight due to dry eye .
then my mouth chronically become dry , skin keep pile up on my feet that i could n't sand it off fast enough to keep up with it , the skin on my hand become scaly and my lip keep crack and my tongue feel like it have pin and needle poke into it .
i stop the multivitamin and my mouth symptom be go , sadly my eyesight be still damage .
i should have just listen to my sister rather than err , jade m.
my doctor be even prescribe fish oil supplement to correct the dry skin problem which could not even put a dent in the problem be cause by my multivitamin .
i do n't consume a lot of salt in my diet and i be on no other medication or drug whatsoever .
if you be experience dry mouth and take a multivitamin stop the vitamin immediately before you ruin your health irreversibly .
take it only a few time a week , if that , and you will realize the vitamin cause this .
i be also tell by a pharmacist that other than the antioxidants , a person get what they need from their diet of most mineral and do not require a multivitamin at all .
so a strictly antioxidant formula be all that be require minus the multivitamin mineral .
please weigh in on this , sorry i be upset about this but i be also trouble now by internet advice that be clearly wrong about this issue and no tell how many others .
tinnitus , vision loss , global cellular degeneration , moisture loss , and even constipation be all cause by general use of multivitamins .
also if you be feed your children multivitamins you should be highly cautious of this too .
even child should only be give a multivitamin a few time a week and not every day .
they should be explain the danger of regular use of vitamin ( in other word follow the prescribed dosage ) .
take it from me who have experience this first hand , my sister who be a nurse , my friend take many meds whose dry mouth stop the very day he cut down on his multivitamin and l.f who be incorrectly advise by , err , donehue .
it be a sad commentary that people have to collectively learn this on their own and that doctor , health specialist and the internet be so out of the loop .
consider that vitamin water and health food drink on top of a multivitamin only compound this problem .
i forget what my sister say be cause this , i seem to recall zinc , but i may be wrong about that .
i have to ask her again .
consider if it be visibly destroy your skin it be also destroy your major organ too .
please comment and offer any further advice on this subject .
i just start on a new kind of multivitamin and my body 's be all kind of crazy .
i use to just take specific vitamin but that get expensive and elaborate and i be miss some thing so i switch to a multi .
the multi have calcium and i know from previous experience that calcium tear my stomach up .
i 'm get older and i know that i need some calcium though .
i do n't have dry mouth but i agree that multivitamins can have unintended consequence .
i have be take high potency multivitamins for almost twenty year .
i have not know any side effect .
one thing , though be to not have certain food too close to the time of the take , because certain one can interact .
for instance , i be take something now that advise to not take regular vitamin c for an hour on either side of take that product .
it suggest discontinue the 12 hour release of vitamin c for as long as that product be be use .
i have to constantly make such comparison to make sure it all work .
i be on very high dose vitamin c , besides my green multiple , that be very concentrate compare top wimpy centrum .
i never have dry mouth until this high dose of c , so i be assume it be the c.
i use it as an antihistamine to control my ibs .
i have overactive mast cell that start pull water into my gut when i run out of c and magnesium ( this i think be cause by take a round of vaccine in 2003 , and the study i find online confirm that mercury in the adjuvants often do cause increase histamine production ) .
so i be on 4000 @-@ 6000 mg of c 4x daily and 400 @-@ 600 mg magnesium 4 x daily .
this be a lot , but i have learn it do control my bowel .
the normal person would get colon blow from these dose , and it firm me up to normal .
this be ultimately an adrenal issue , as the adrenals be throw out huge amount of electrolyte and i be sure other stuff , so until i realize this i be in constant loose bowel lose my nutrient .
but it have cause dry mouth .
i do n't think it be as bad as some i have read here .
there be some archaelogists who believe that two site in syria could be the world 's early city .
tell brak and tell hamoukar in the ne of syria may have exist back in 3700bc .
seem plausible .
damascus be generally consider to be the oldest continuously inhabit city in the world .
it 's mention by name in genesis as a place where abraham stop on his way to canaan from ur of the chaldees ( in modern @-@ day iraq ) .
accord to this , american citizen can now be arrest and detain indefinitely without trial .
do that mean that anyone can be take and put into a hole forever without justification ?
if so , i think it 's scary .
but who decide that the person be actually a member of or work for al qaeda ?
what court can review that decision ?
well , the verdict just come in .
guilty of involuntary manslaughter .
the judge would not let him be release until sentence either .
the judge say his behavior be wreckless and the community could be in harm 's way . ( not his exact word ) .
i be glad he be lose his license .
no matter what , he never should have give michael jackson that propofol .
the man practiced here for many year .
the local tv news be run nothing but outrage over the conviction .
not one word in favor of it .
the local abc channel feature a legal expert who deride the trial , call it a travesty , make doctor afraid to treat patient and so forth .
he seem to think a " proper " court would have let murray go free .
an increase proportion of us children be so severely obese as to be at immediate risk for life @-@ threaten complication include type 2 diabetes .
some will become candidate for treatment at newly establish pediatric surgical weight loss programs throughout the country .
as an alternative approach , involvement of state protective service might be consider , include placement into foster care in carefully select situation .
ultimately , government can reduce the need for such intervention through investment in the social infrastructure and policy to improve diet and promote physical activity among children .
severe obesity in children -- be that a form of child abuse ?
should the state step in and save these kid from their parent ?
david... you 're so not look at the big picture .
if this current trend continue , a whole generation or two will be lose .
consider that we be globally compete against india and china who so far do n't suffer this epidemic , we will fall farther behind in almost every aspect .
these next generation will become a major burden on our health care system .
prevention be need now not later when it will much likely not work .
cheap to fix it now then to let it cripple the entire economy at a later date .
i live in ca and i sign an affiliation agreement 12 @/@ 09 which state that i be to pay a monthly fee to the owner .
the owner say " not " to pay until my business have pick up .
although my business be struggle , i have try several time to start pay this fee .
each time the owner say " no " do n't worry about .
we have now part way , for both personal and professional reason , and now they be take me to small claim court for the affiliation fee they say i do n't have to pay plus their legal fee ( i be be bully ) .
have anyone dealt with a situation like this ?
i think a verbal agreement would override a write agreement , but be that hard to prove ?
i mean obviously the proof be that they be sue me for back fee that i have not be pay because business have be slow .
please , help or share your story .
it sound like there be more than what you have post .
did you break a lease or agreement with them ?
leave early ?
it sound like they be waive certain fee , with the understand that you be go to stay for the long haul .
if you leave early , then they now want all their fee .
a write agreement trump a verbal agreement .
a write agreement be hard proof .
without that it 's your word against their word .
you should have put the money be escrow if you feel uncomfortable with the arrangement .
my newspaper have an article today on animal hoarder , list some signifigant recent case :
one woman live on an old school bus with 117 dog , 4 cat and 2 chicken .
one man have 500 dog .
another have 80 cat .
two week ago , animal service confiscate 39 cat live with a man in a van .
most hoarder live in unimaginable filth .
( i do n't want to post the photo because they be really gross.)
most of these people be charge with animal abuse and neglect and they be fine and jail .
do you think these people be criminal ?
i watch animal planet ( way too late at night this weekend ) and see a florida animal cop .
they bust a hoarder with 82 dog and confiscate 78 of them ( i think legally in fla you can have 4 ) .
the dog be in such bad shape , some could n't walk because their nail be so long , most be flea infest and have be sleep in their own feces .
there be two set of puppy in the house and as they pan around the house , it appear that there be at least two other set of puppy in the make .
the woman be not prosecute as long as she be willing to give up the amount need to take her back to the legal limit .
and they check up on her after that .
apparently the media run a story about it and over 40 dog be adopt the first day they be available .
i go for mentally ill as well , but like freeduck say , sometimes the only way to get them treatment be to prosecute .
they just tell this woman they would keep check up on her ( randomly so she could n't hide pet like she be when they be round them up ) and as long as she have only 4 , she be fine .
that seem reasonable to me since no dog be dead , no dog be starve , they just need more attention .
it be a much better story than the dog chain to a tree for 3 week in florida heat that finally succumbed...made me cry .
now those people should be tie to a tree with no food and water and see how they do...
we have our own local " cat lady " who make the newspaper headline a couple of decade ago .
she live in a filthy , almost uninhabitable house surround by cat , cat , cat .
many people try to help her , but she make it impossible for anyone to give her effective assistance even in the face of have her home condemn .
and that 's what eventually happen .
her house be declare a public nuisance and the city tore it down .
i 'm pretty sure this old lady have more than just a few screw loose .
i see her many year ago at a local supermarket .
she be wear a drab winter coat and a large colorful scarf around her head with her unkempt gray wig hair stick out .
she be slump against a wall and the store personnel have call an ambulance .
it be a pathetic sight .
i think it be a kind of depression myself , where one let go of a lot of effort to keep up with daily life except to ' care ' for animal , and then be overwhelm but see no way out of it - except that they do , i gather , start again .
a kind of compulsion .
not that i do n't want them stop .
be this a kind of ocd ? a pre @-@ alzheimers ?
there be something to be say for humane institutional care , and i be not talk about the dog .
tricky subject , on which i can see several side .
please - this be not a thread about the case , as such , i find those thread concern - but about some of the difference between the american , and some other country ' practice - and their effect .
for instance : i ) in australia , and , i believe , great britain at the very least , the name of a juvenile involve in a criminal matter be not reveal , whether they be allege victim , or allege perpetrator , except in very special circumstance
( eg they have be kidnap , and police seek public help to find them - or they have be murder - or if they be allege to have commit a very serious crime and be be try as adult , or if it be in some way in the public interest.)
to these non @-@ us eye , it be very shock to see the name and photograph of the young man allege to have be abuse by jackson splash all over the media -
here , juvenile be protect to the point that , on the few occasion i have accompany a minor who be rape or sexually abuse to court , while she @/@ he give testimony - if the offender ( these be case where , oddly , a conviction be obtain , so i do not say " allege " offender ) be also a minor , it be a big deal to be allow in to be a support person for the victim , because i would hear the name of the offender .
what do people think of the us practice ?
what be the reason for it ?
which would you prefer ?
what do you think be the impact on young people so identified ?
ii ) the media circus .
here , both defence and prosecution be very limit as to what they can say about a case that be before the court . the matter be consider sub judice .
occasionally , with high profile case , the police will " leak " thing - and @/@ or the media will attempt , within the letter of the law , to try a case in the media ( the lindy chamberlain case be a terrible example of both these occurrence ) -
but the organised propaganda campaign that i think i detect in the us be not generally present .
full detail be generally releasable only after the trial .
again , the spectacle be very shock to these non @-@ us eye .
i presume it be allow because of an interpretation of free speech ?
do people think it aid justice ? that it be societally positive ? what do you think ?
iii ) this be unrelated - but , do people think this be go to be another black v white case , and do you think that high profile non @-@ caucasian people still - despite their wealth and power - be unfairly treat in the us justice system ?
i would think that , similarly to here , that poor and obscure people of colour would tend to be - but i be interested in view re people who have achievedfame and fortune .
judge the us legal system based on what go on in , say , the jackson case be probably a bad idea .
i 've serve on jury duty several time and come away highly impress with how seriously everybody take their various responsibility .
a case like jackson 's , alas , or the kobe bryant case betray many standard .
the media have some role in this , as do glory @-@ hound attorney on both side .
i 'm sure , for example , that a minor 's name should never be publicize in a case like this .
i 'm try to pay as little attention to this case as possible , because i think it 's more a freak show than anything else .
please do n't judge our system on the basis of the jackson trial !
we have very strict publication ban around identity of abuse minor in canada .
the person charge often cannot be identify , as their name , and the detail of the relationship to the child , would mean the child could possibly be identify .
sleep next to the elephant mean we 've probably become a bit jaded to the circus . but the law be much tighter here .
i would be extraordinarily happy not to make such a judgment , d'artagnan ! !!! but - it be allow to happen !
would the name of the child , for instance , normally be suppress ?
how often do case become media circus ?
i guess what i be get at be the different law on such matters...
interest to have such difference in the system of country that grew so similarly , ehbeth .
we seem much more like you guy - but , i suppose , the us invent its law after a revolution - we inherit them after century of slow evolution with no cataclysm , and make change slowly .
i think but i 'm not completely sure if you can print any name of a sexual abuse victim in canada without the express permission of the victim .
you cannot print the name of any minor whether the victim or perpetrator of any crime , except in very special @/@ rare circumstance where a minor be at large and a suspected danger to the community or themselves .
a court order be need in these case and once the minor be apprehend the name and or picture must not be print again , ever .
news outlet be rarely allow to print anything specific in these case as well .
in case of family abuse the name be rarely print , if ever , in order to protect the victim .
i have no idea the victim in the jackson case be publicize .
i have see picture of his previous victim which i though be pretty appal but generally the face have be smudge out .
what i hope will happen here be that people will come along to present the case for allow the name to be make public , because it be incomprehensible to me -
but there must be reason for the us system to be the way it be on these matter .
it be n't as though people in the us be not interested in and critical of their own system - gotta be a reason...
i think they be get ready to bring the first miner up .
over 2,000 feet up , in a little tube , through a little tunnel .
on cnn i see a picture they show of the face of the miner , and i see at least a couple guy that look way too big to fit in that thing .
i guess they 'll be suck in their gut .
wow , 69 day .
that 's like a full season of big brother .
i guess the whole rescue be suppose to take about two day , if their estimate be correct and nothing go wrong .
and the whole thing will be watch live all over the world .
here 's a place where there be some livestreams if you want to check it out .
americans could learn a lot from the chilean people as the 33 miner be rescue .
they come together to support and save the miner ' life .
so much better than the political party fight go on over the come election in the u.s.
i have a question .
the last man , one of the rescuer , must be able to lock the rescue tube 's door correctly from the inside ?
i can understand how he could hook up the oxygen pack and other devise , but i can n't figure out how he can lock the door so it do n't come loose if no one be there to do it from the outside .
he will have to hold it shut with a handle or maybe a bungee cord hold on the inside .
good question .
look like these guy be gonna get out in time to do their christmas shop
i be sorry ; but i think chili be part of america...
one of them at least...
they come in two 's you know...inner mongolia , and outer mongolia...that sort of thing...
in any event , i do not know the answer to your question...
it would seem that for most door , there be a handle on the inside and the outside...
just like hammer have claw so you can go both way with a nail...
speak from experience , it be damn difficult some time not have reverse on a motor cycle...
you can n't stop ride without think about ride later...
here i be , and how do i get out..
i 'm watch on the telly yet another shooter ( orlando fla ) news say 8 victim take to hospital .
you know what david be go to tell you in a few minute : if the others have gun to protect themselves , they all would be dead by now .
that 's how gun logic work , my dear dys .
guess all the gun crazy psychotic be flip out of the woodwork .
yeah , and then i 'm a gun owner .
and your """" enlighten """" solution be ?
my " enlighten " solution be for everyone to determine who might become a potential shooter and kill them before they be able to harm anyone .
do my sarcasm equate adequately to yours ?
i 'm talk specifically about the show of the content of the package that he send to nbc .
i realize that this stuff will probably come out anyway , and that the public really really want to see what be in that package , but be n't it also in a way glorify @/@ validate the guy 's action and give him exactly what he want ?
for instance , the image of him point a gun at the camera be on just about every news site i see online , and the video clip of his rantings be start to show up everywhere as well . and his write .
i realize how fascinate it be to try to get inside this nutball 's head , but be there any way to put the news out there about him without give him rock star status ?
be it even possible ?
i wonder how long until this stuff show up on murderauction.com or one of those other disgust site .
i think there can be detail ( what happen when , who try to do what , etc.) without spread his own propaganda . because that 's what it be .
he stage @-@ manage this -- he want the badass stuff out there , he want that last image .
just show a small picture of who he be , the original one be fine .
the rest be unnecessary , and article bbb and nimh have link to argue convincingly that the propaganda be downright dangerous .
the american public have reach the point in our culture , that the news that get the most coverage be the news that play to the lowest common denominator amongst us .
think about it . for week , there be pamela anderson and the baby . then it be don imus . now all we hear about be that murderous nutjob who act on his sick delusion .
it be like the newspaper and tv want to beat out the supermarket rag . ugh !
i 've be enjoy the nytimes blog , primarily by michael kimmelman , who i 'm use to read when he write about art.
but he 's join by several other good writer who be apparently hang around the us open type away as they feel like it .
i like all the different viewpoint .
have always like vecsey 's write , but can n't read him in the paper lately because he 's now in the time select group that you have to pay for to get access to , even on the day of the article .
my favorite writer on the blog be kimmelman , he seem to have my eye , if i have his .
i 'm enjoy the play by play , as it be , so much that i want to see if i can go back and read the blog on the world cup .
probably not , as so much time have pass .
anybody on a2k follow this ?
go to the match ?
i do follow international tennis -- one of the first thing i want to glance over on the morning newspaper .
not go to the match , though ?
well , so be you follow the us open ( http : //www.usopen.org/)?
who be your fave player ?
yeah , she sure be a tennis prodigy .
she 's always lack the killer serve that be a key to today 's power game , though .
if she do n't have it in her heyday , she 's not go to have it now in the twilight of her career .
hey , hope your day be go well !
i have a question for anyone who feel that want to answer .
i have be watch a bit of ' rhythmic gymnastics ' on youtube...i just find it amazing...it 's very cool .
i do n't have child , but when i get to that stage , i 'd love a daughter of mine to take part in this really cool sport .
my question though be , be it true or just a myth that while all this crazy flexibility at a young age be nice , at old age they will be in pain and not able to move at all ?
if it be true , i 'd prefer not to have any part in it , but if it 's not true , it would be great to know .
can anyone help ?
i 'm no expert , but nadia comenechi , the famous romanian gymnast , have no health problem from her gymnastics day though her former gymnast husband be wracked with arthritis .
thank for you quick reply .
could it be that different people react to it in different way ?
maybe you just enjoy it while you do , and if you find it painful afterwards...bad luck , if not...great !
have anyone else get any other thought ?
i 'm not familiar with rhythmic gymnastics , but i know both gymnast and dancer be prone to on @-@ the @-@ job injury -- and the effect of those injury can add up .
the behaviour of australian cricket fan be of more concern than the thousand of spirit barmy army member set to descend upon our shore for this summer 's ash series , say victoria 's police .
the number of english fan travel to australia be expect to easily surpass the 10,000 who come for the 2002 @-@ 03 ash series because of last year 's victory and because of an online ticket fiasco that saw thousand of english fan nab ash ticket mean for australians .
there have be some discussion here about the ash .
not the test series , the actual one .
apparently the aussies ( a devious lot ) have say that when they win the series ( that 's if they do , but they do n't think that way ) they want to take the small urn from its permanent place at lord 's cricket ground back to oz .
mcc say , on your bike cobber , because that urn be a gift , not a trophy , and it stay where it be .
what say the aussies now ?
i 'm sit here pull my hair out because my roomate be watch the master on tv . i 'd rather drink battery acid than watch golf .
while semi @-@ watch , i just realize something : while the golfer be set up his shot , and about to swing , all the fan get very quiet for them . then i think about fan at sport games( golf be n't a sport event , it 's a hobby ) , and they scream , yell , and do their best to annoy the oppose team 's player and throw them off their game .
why the hell do golfer escape that aspect ? the pressure and ability to block stuff out add to the challenge . why be they so special ?
this make me just hate watch golf on tv even more .
i love golf .
do n't understand watch it .
also do n't understand course that use cart .
none of that new @-@ fangled crap for me .
walk , and carry your bloody club .
so there be others out there other than myself that hate golf and believe its not a sport ? thats wonderful !
golf be a sport... an incredibly bore sport...
tennis player get the same ' silent treatment ' from spectator -- not exactly sure why...
bite me , slappy .
hatred of golf be for people with brain deficiency .
one other thing that must annoy you . in all other sport ( yeah , golf be a sport ) ...there be ref and umps and all that . and the people play the sport argue with those official all the time .
in golf...you gotta call foul on yourself . and golfer do !
there ain't nothing in the world better than golf . ( well...maybe one thing . but even that , you can eventually get enough of . you can never get enough of golf.)
will tom ever return to the pat ?
ever ? yeah , next season .
it 's look like he be out for the year , though depedning on his rehabilitation , he may try to be available for the playoffs .
it 's tough to say though .
my money be on brady to return next year .
i do n't think he 's willing to let the previous season 's super bowl be his last .
or it be possible you will stand there with a freeze grin on your face , unable to say anything remotely intelligent .
we can help you !
several of us a2k'ers have create a support group to painlessly guide you towards appear knowledgeable even if , like many of us , you be clueless .
they be call the wildcard game .
you will need to invest a grand total of 7 minute . total . max .
please indicate , by noon on saturday , jan 8 th , your pick on these 4 game :
ny jet @ indianapolis colt
baltimore raven @ kansas city chief
new orleans saint @ seattle seahawks
green bay packer @ philadelphia eagle
the jet aggravate me no end in fantasy football ( sanchez be my quarterback ) , so this seem to me a perfectly good reason to pick the colt , who also aggravate me , but not as much .
i 'm place my faith that the jet 's defense will kick in one more time .
plus i like it that no one else seem to have faith in the jet .
besides this wild card round be just fodder for the real game when the patriot start play and ultimately take the whole burrito , ( enchiladas be n't classy enough for tom brady and the gang ) .
instead of a coin toss - and because i know absolutely nothing about football @- i 'm go to do it by which city i know @/@ like better and see how well i do .
so my pick will be :
new york
baltimore
new orleans
philadelphia
just as an experiment to begin with , but i be fairly competititive in spirit , so if one of my team make it to the super bowl - i 'll watch it instead of the andy griffith show marathon and eat me some chicken wing and drink a beer or two .
sound fun to me...can't hurt .
be there a prize ?
in an article in toronto 's " globe and mail " newspaper , john polanyi , a nobel laureate and member of the department of chemistry at the university of toronto , recommend that afghanistan farmer be allowed( you might even say " be encourage ") to grow poppy ( opium ) legally .
he argue that there be a shortage of painkilling medication , particularly in poor , third world country , and that afghanistan could supply the need poppy at a lower price than commercially produce painkiller .
i see the interview he give on cbc @-@ tv recently and he seem to know what he be talk about .
as he put it : " the afghan farmer have to make a live to fee his - often large - family .
we can force him to produce the poppy illegally and fee into the illegal drug market or we can buy the poppy from him and help provide pain @-@ kill drug ."
as i post sometime ago , country such as :france , australia and india be permit to grow poppy legally for the production of drug - why not allow the afghan farmer the same privilege ?
have a look at the article and see if you agree with him or not .
the problem with poppy cultivation be n't the grow of the crop itself .
the problem be oversight and market .
opiate have legitimate medicinal use .
unfortunately , the product of the papver somniferum plant have far more monetary value on the black market than when sell to legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturer .
thank for the article and the background - i read both .
there would be problem though .
the criminal element that currently buy the crop be still go to try and get their hand on it , so the crop would need to be guard .
that 's go to cost a fair bit and probably result in bloodshed .
hot world conflict in the computer near you ! live ! entertain ! wild !
the future of the news reality show , or whatever should one call it .
kevin site tour the world 's conflict zone with digital technology that will allow him to blog and transmit image and video from war ridden area daily .
one can contact him there , or chat with him live on the website .
now while i know he 's do it voluntarily and probably for a shootload of money , i have to say i find the idea of such a project odd and somewhat disconcerning .
will it start a new wave of journalist seek out the most dangerous situation to sell their goods ?
competition on who can go the farthest ?
and will that encourage the side in conflict to up their performance , so to speak , get international live coverage straight from the front ?
especially if there will be more and more keven sites'es roam the world ?
thousand of journalist already do seek out war zone , sure .
but this be take it to a whole new level , i think .
anyway , i 'm confuse about how i feel about it .
i will surely look in often to see where he 's at and will be curious about the report and live video .
it have a voyeuristic element to it , do n't it ?
ah , what be this world come to .
and what do the future of journalism hold for us ?
can we control it in any way ?
what do you think ?
gus , that 's what 's make me uncomfortable .
it just seem like a stoopid idea to me .
but i won't deny that i be also curious , although it make me feel kinda dirty .
partake in make a violent conflict a part of entertainment culture .
well , more so than it already be . yecchh .
everything in life have a positive , and a negative side .
the good thing about this be that they might be able to record what really be happen in certain area of the world in case the government of the world tell us different .
if they make money good for them !
if they survive many of these men come back home change , and sometimes not for the better .
they could also come back wound or sick .
to me , it 's a good thing to be able to choose how your go to die when it 's for a good cause .
there be incident where the bastard in charge decide it would be best for a certain reporter to " die in conflict "
mr. site better tread carefully .
of course , i imagine he 'll have quite an entourage and that might ensure his safety from the more devious sort .
the un or at least some of the member threaten sanction .
sanction , what sanction could the un impose , refuse to purchase the lifeblood of industry " oil "?
iraq could on the other hand cut their production and cause the price of that commodity to go through the roof .
be the threat of sanction just another instance where the us and the un be just blow smoke ?
it 's blow smoke as it 's the people who will end up suffer from any such move .
if the un really want to make a difference , they could threaten to pass a resolution ! !!!!
ooooooh ! that ought to scare ' em...."
and bush be clamering the loudest .
do he , i wonder , think that would be his excuse to invade .
it would be wmd 's all over again .
i can n't believe that even the crew that " own " the us at the present time would do something as rash and ill conceive .
let me start by say that i love morocco .
i 've be there a few time in the last 6 or 7 year and have become familiar with its people and custom and geography and unique challenge .
each time i 've visit , i 've notice immense , fast @-@ pace progress , both economically and socially .
since my first visit there a network of well @-@ build highway have be build , enable european and internal tourism and commerce to flourish .
i 've witness cell phone come on the market and virtually explode .
high speed internet be available .
house build and land development be through the roof .
agricultural technology have take off and enable farmer to be profitable and efficient , as well as increase the availability of affordable food to all moroccans .
my aim for this thread be to periodically discuss new development and economic initiative in morocco as they come about in the news , as well as any other news that be deem curious or interesting .
i 'm interested in morocco .
i know there be some cell there of folk who want to cause havoc but that be presumably not the whole population .
the country have seem attractive to me for year .
at the least , i be interested in hear more about it .
don , could you be more specific about why morocco be to be avoid ?
this all remind me of myself sit at a train station in italy at about 5 @:@ 30 a.m . one morning .
my husband and i wander in after buy our train ticket to get cappuccini and dolci before the ride... and share a table with two tourist from the us .
on my right be a table of what turn out to be moroccan laborers .
my xhub and the tourers be talk away about something and i glance over at the ( moroccans ) and we start talk in poor italian , which be how i find out they be from morocco .
very polite sleepy early morning nice conversation.. i turn to the others and the lady say , " dear , you musn't talk with them , they be dangerous ."
i can n't remember what i say , but it be short , succinct .
that be a long time ago .
not every immigrant from far away land be the devil in disguise , and neither be all of us .
well say , jln !
i have n't be there myself but my 3 son and a friend went a couple of year ago .
they say a ) it be one of the most beautiful place they have be and b ) it be the place in the world they have be most hassle and cheat .
i think , too , that as 4 young men travel together , they be look upon as a challenge by local youth .
they say there be fight amongst kid in the street and this seem to be normal and tolerate .
so it be a society with a very male testosterone @-@ rich style .
the shop run by women be altogether less hassly , more friendly .
one thing they find particularly hard to deal with be other young men attach themselves to their group and be undislodgeable ( a nwe word and it 's only 9 am ! ) .
my eldest who be especially friendly and tolerant try to make friend with these people but in the end they all want something .
that can be dispirit for the open @-@ mind and open @-@ hearted .
but they enjoy their stay generally , would certainly not avoid it in future .
as for lump all islamic country together as a no go area - what complete nonsense !
as we 're go to turkey and syria at the end of this month , and expect to have a wonderful trip as independent traveller , i be definitely make a political statement -
i do not lump all muslims together , and believe that 98 % be friendly to traveller .
most be undoubtedly anti @-@ american and anti @-@ bush , but that be not a sentiment confine to the islamists .
my engagement ring @/@ wed ring and other personal ring along with my husband 's wed ring be steal .
at least we assume so .
we go camp and put them together in the car .
after camp and come home we search high and low and could not find them .
we call the campground and the owner say they have clean our campsite and do not find anything .
so we have to assume some one stole them .
we do have the car unlock at time so it be a definate possibility .
really stink at it be just our anniversary right before .
yep , that stink .
we be rob one time right before christmas .
came home , and the basement door have be kick in .
all they take be wrap christmas gift , and all of my husband 's sock .
sound funny now , but at the time i feel very violate at the thought of stranger go through my house .
@mags314772,
yes i can say the one thing be at least it be n't in my house .
the idea of some one go through your house be as bad as them take christmas present .
wow , the afghanis be in for a life @-@ change shock to their culture and way of life .
tribal leader , international corporation , international government and border neighbors will all be vie with each other and the afghani people for a piece of the action .
it will be interesting to watch who take what side .
will china and russia now side with the taliban to take over the country and exploit the riches ?
will the us help the afghani people to learn from our mistake and protect their natural environment from strip mine ?
will al queda now return to the country to enrich themselves with the profit ?
will the lithium deposit take away from effort by al gore and others to invest in and invent research and development in improve battery storage for the very young renewable clean energy industry in the u.s ?
i dont think that any vast deposit find in one land that barely exist as a state and have almost no industry will be a setup for a despotic regime or a surge of taliban takeover of province within which be these deposit .
since much of it lie in the mountainous region of the west and southwest , these be already the subject of the new campaign against a resurface taliban .
these mineral , especially the lithium , will need major process before its in a commercial state for battery .
long term development for all kind of battery for entire new gizmos ( not just blackberry ) will be based on better and better lithium cell .
most of the world recoverable deposit lie in south america lake deposit and in our own western north carolina in vast quartz deposit .
if they find deposit of rhodium and platinum itd be a major reason to enter negotiation to help em develop their resource .
you can have all the rear metal in the world in your country , but the support infrastructer 's must be in place , i.e. road , power plant , process facilties , water , ton and ton of water , chemical supplier , etc.
so what may appear as a rich mineral bonanza , will be shoot down for now and the forseable future , because the cost of extraction , be larger that any profit margin .
the administrative and legislative branch of our government can n't agree on how to make a dent in our deficit .
the solution ?
go on vacation for a month and appoint a bipartisan group of senator and representative to try to work out some sort of plan .
their mission be to reduce next year 's deficit by $ 1.2tn over the next 10 year .
they must come up with a plan by thanksgiving - roughly 100 day - that 7 of the 12 member can agree on .
if they fail , there will be across the board cut .
if they succeed , their plan must pass the house and the senate with no alteration .
i , too , be skeptical , edgar .
the 3 dems and 3 repubs from the house seem to be intractably commit to their party ' more extreme wing .
the senator be be describe as " dealmakers , " willing to compromise at the end .
we will have to see .
in the meantime , if any of you find biography of the 12 member of the super committee , please link or write your own profile of them .
i 've say elsewhere that i do n't think they 're expect to accomplish anything .
they may put out a proposal but it will probably fail in one chamber or the other .
neither chamber can come to consensus on substantive reform , imo , and the trigger will be pull .
the trigger be specifically choose because each one be desirable to one party and not anethema to the other .
it never be a good idea and only seem to be a good idea to the moron .
there be never any reason to think that this be go to work , and now that it will not they be go to try to defuse the trigger...but that might not work either .
i dont know what the vegas odds of gut the defense department be but i put it at around 30 % .
it be always go to happen at some point , but maybe 10 @-@ 20 year down the line , not now .
if this happen it will be a major break of faith with the american people .
million of americans go to war for america , and come back break or otherwise give up a lot , and now we look to take a huge chunk of their hide because washington no long work .
this , folk , be go to be a problem .
edit : " delay and pray " have not work in europe , and it will not work in america .
in both place we see from our so call leader a massive refusal to step up to the plate .
bullshit ! !! we be our own people .
the reason we be fight the world war be because the very rich who dont want to pay their share of tax want the protection of the government for the wealth and job they have import to other country .
what the majority of the u.s citizen get in return be nothing but a lack of job and a reduction in our ability to fee our family .
time to plug yourself in for a recharge , youre start to run down .
if you wanna defeat obama , seem to me you need a candidate with something between their ear .
all i see be bozo and friend on the gop side .
( hint : id vote for a republican if one of substance show up , im not too thrill with the job obama do .
i think he waste his capital on the health care right at the begin of the worst economic situation weve see in our lifetime .
unfortunately , you cannot really think that any of the present gaggle of gop candidate have get substance ) .
thus the analysis that i have put up on a2k in multiple place that the us federal government be corrupt , and be run by the corporate class .
we see the oppression of the people by the government in other area besides economics though , for instance i have point out how this oppression be weave onto our sex law .
the oppressor should not get too comfy , as oppressor the world over be find out they get over thrown by force of public will .
the oppressor of the american people will eventually suffer the same fate...
where be theodore " teddy " roosevelt when we need him --- again ?
the greatest irony i 've see here at a2k hawkeye be although i agree with on the statement that the us be an oligarchy or a plutocracy i believe you have foolishly drunk the kool @-@ aid to think the tea party be genuine in it 's pursuit to save the country from " our oppressor " when every move they propose be a basic tenet to strengthen the status quo .
clearly you be too blind by your personal selfishness and greed to see and feel the rain fall on your head from your tea party overlord .
government exist for a reason .
progressive government exist and should continue to exist in order to protect it 's citizen from the raid and loot horde of the multibillion dollar conglomerate and bank institution who themselves exist in order to set up a select small population into extreme wealth and power .
i be not of the tea party , i be a radical leftist formerly a revolutionary currently a socialist .
it could be argue that a better word be collectivist...
i strongly support libertarian political action because i want to see individual once again free enough from government oppresion that they can choose to come together in collective effort .
what we have now be a sham socialism impossed by a government which be own by the coporate class , whos only mission be to grab more wealth .
we be free from government oppression .
now if we can free ourselves from our billion dollar overlord perhaps we can enjoy real freedom and get rid of our bought politician .
the euro country be afraid to let greece go bankrupt , because it will be follow by spain and ireland .
if that happen , the euro 's value will drop to unimaginable level , and inflation will hit all their country .
the european central bank euro policy continue to exacerbate the problem for greece and the other euro country with huge deficit .
france and germany be try their best to prop up greece with more loan and forgive of loan , but that seem like a lose proposition when greece really do n't have an economy that can pay back the loan they already have .
it seem like desperation time for the euro zone country , but the majority be in no position to assist greece with their grow deficit .
how long will this plug of hole in the dam last ?
germany and france be in no position to save all of them when the water 's rush get stronger by the month ( grow deficit ) .
greece 's debt be 179 % of gdp .
how will they survive ?
i believe we 're on the rim of an economic maelstrom .
greece be only the latest symptom of a financial disease that have become pandemic .
i believe that , too .
rather like an individual who work hard , produce useful work , and save for the future suddenly find himself wipe out because of the act of a central bank , somewhere .
you guy be depress me .
can n't i just go back to blissful ignorance ?
after wwii , the recovery be fast .
there be pent up demand for everything after the war , because most civilian earn money build our war machine for four year , and there be hardly any consumer goods to buy .
even food be put on ration .
what be " funny " to some degree be the " cheap " junk we import from japan , because americans be ready to spend money .
i remember lighter from japan be make from soda pop can , and they must have sell million of those .
it appear a global recession be on its way .
a bush league president and political party should never be near the steer wheel of the us economy .
their reckless policy and ideology can only lead backwards to a 18 th or 19 th century society of robber baron and ideological cutthroat .
it 's too late ; we 've be a recession many month ago ; most family could not continue to live their lifestyles of a couple of year ago because food and fuel cost have increase to the point most could not keep up with those higher cost .
as family member lose their job and home , many also lose their health insurance .
that 's a biggie for most family .
you can listen to our government about " not be in a recession , " but i see it different .
some important cricket be go to be play out in the next coupla month :
australia take on sl ( or rather australian spectator take on murali ) ; india sweat it out with pakistan ; sa prepare to face nz .
there 's lot to talk about .
would the ozzies and indians ( british be allow , too ) want to talk over a beer or two ?
i 'm here !
glad they give stuart mcgill a run .
the new year test in sydney be aus vs india .
i go to the last aus @-@ india test .
we arrive , and the scoreboard read india 7 @-@ 705. aarrggghhh !
i take a photo of it .
was still a draw , though . steve waugh 's last sydney test .
hope that do n't happen again !
australian rock legend billy thorpe have die this morning after suffer a major heart attack overnight .
thorpe , 60 , die in the early hour of the morning after he be rush to sydney 's st vincent 's public hospital at 2 am ( aedt ) , a spokesman have say .
did he do anything a non @-@ aussie may recognise ?
billy move to the us in 1976 .
children of the sun be release in 1979 top twenty .
billy headline his own sold out tour through 1979 and 80 .
sometime there abouts his record lable went belly up .
polygram assume the right .
live as fast as he die .
at least in the early year .
they should have a one minute silence up at the cross .
after strategically ' excise ' bit of australia in order to thwart people smuggler ( you can n't land in australia if we pass a law to say it be n't australia this week ) , our pint @-@ size pm have decide to think big .
how big .
real big .
the govt be plan to create a ' security zone ' that extend 1,000 nautical mile around the country .
this would allow the monitor and possible interception of any vessel within the zone .
amazingly , other nearby nation ( indonesia for one ) be a bit put out as it extend australian soverienty well into sth east asia .
and why ?
the usa have one....
there must be some sort of international bench @-@ mark for piss off other nation in play here .
this govt have also repeatadly say that it will take independent action to pre @-@ emptively strike at ' terror ' and we be sourcing supplier of cruise missile .
now , it be pretty obvious that australia won't be attack from the east ( nz ) , the south ( antarctica ) or the west ( big ocean then madagascar ) .
so , ' security zone ' be shorthand for , ' you sneaky little brown people better not try any funny business '.
of course they just happen to be the most populous muslim nation on earth - of course we should always walk tall and talk tough when deal with them .
could you imagine how tough washington would be if there be the ' islamic republic of canada ' with a billion or more people sit on their northern border ?
you will never ever appease indonesia .
they could n't give a stuff about australia no matter what we say .
they would have invade us long ago if there be n't a big stretch of ocean in between .
if i be to describe accurately and succinctly my estimation of that post , australia , i might be ban .
i shall content myself by simply say that you be utterly ignorant of where stilly might have be , and what his experience or feeling might be , nor do i see his whereabouts as form the basis of any rational argument .
perhaps fortunately , however , you have make no attempt to formulate any such argument .
well be n't that progressive of them...
this be the second time they 've do so .
the most amaze thing though be california , often describe as the very heart of american liberalism , vote conservative on just about every one of the proposition out there .
they do approve assist suicide , but i think vote against every other ' liberal ' proposal .
i honestly think the pendulum be begin to swing back from the far leave .
we can always hope .
once the traditional marriage be safe , then i be confident the people will get busy to provide a way for gay couple to enjoy the same protection as married people do , and i think that will pass with scarcely more than a murmor .
a new report on global warm , the product of a task force of academic , business leader and politician , chair by former blair administration transport minister stephen byers and republican senator olympia snowe , be deeply unsettle .
i love when those that do n't get it claim there can n't be global warm cause it 's 8 degree and theres 3 feet of snow on the ground .
that 's actually one of the thing ( record / increase snowfall ) that indicate global warn be take place .
what i do n't get be why some so vehemently deny global warm .
what be the benefit of deny that it be happen or accept that it be possible ?
ya learn something new every day....
ambergris be use in perfume or as a perfume .
i think it be a type of amber ( a tree resin product ) , but it be totally unrelated .
ambergris be basically , sperm whale trace .
you know how hawk and coyote vomit up the undigestible part of their food ?
so do sperm whale .
the stuff the eject be fould and gross , but after it float in the sun , on the ocean , for many year , it become ambergris - worth a small fortune too.....
there be nothing the 19 th century whaler prize more highly -- a good haul of ambergris could allow all the ship officer to retire , or buy their own ship -- and allow the sailor to get famously drink , until they be rob and go lookin ' for a new berth...
i find that quite interesting .
imagine break open a chunk of a ambergris and discover something like that...
" hey , kris , what the hell be this thing inside the ambergris ? "
" let me have a look .
i believe that be the hard beak of a giant squid ! "
that initial article say it be ban in the us under some endanger species thingie -- why , though ?
it seem like it 's pretty separate from any harm to the animal .
( if they kill one for it , if they get anything at all they 'll some foul @-@ smell bile that have to be float on the sea for 10 year or more...)
the ambergris itself be consider an endanger species , soz .
it be consider to be a float ecosystem , sort of a microcosm of a rain forest , and every time one be destroy scientist lose valuable information that might have be use for discover a cure for cancer or some other dealdly malady .
obama dramatically escalate the extrajudicial killings by america around the world ( mainly in yemen , pakistan and afghanistan ) since take office .
for example , in his first year in office america carry out more drone attack in pakistan than bush 's entire presidency .
the next year ?
he more than double his own increase rate .
obama be send out these drone to kill people at a rate of once every 4 day .
bush 's average be about once every 50 .
we 've make a new generation of enemy in pakistan and afghanistan for these assassination ( and the " night raid " obama escalate in afghanistan ) .
other than bin laden , nobody we be kill have anything to do with 9 @/@ 11 .
a decade later many of the young men we be assassinate ( along with the civillians that constitute one third of the number kill by these drone ) must have be kid when that happen .
do you think this be a good idea ?
if this be bush would you be protest it ?
vote against him ?
why can obama , the greatest drone murderer in history , get away with it with hardly a word about it ?
he even get away with crack joke about predator drone while i know damn well that most of you here would have excoriate bush for something like that .
so why be it ?
do you all just not know that obama have escalate the killings do in your name or do you just not care anymore ?
be war cool now ?
are these kill moral now ?
why be the life bush be kill more valuable than the one that obama be kill ?
why be you guy gonna vote for this warmonger ?
when you go on a crusade you do n't pull any punch with your headline , do you , robert ?
that 's a bit over the top , don'cha think ?
i state long ago that i no long support him .
i will vote third party , if at all , since neither major party want to nominate somebody with my value .
i see your point , which you make well on the other thread .
i have a discussion a week or so ago with a old lib friend think about vote for ron paul , and i go on about my old theory about watch for the company someone keep .
that 's from my hematology day , when if you find a blast cell in a peripheral smear , it be very likely a progenitor of the cell around it , thus help identify the leukemia .
( long ago , do n't know what they do on that now.)
thus , i might like a republican , but would worry about the administration that came along with him or her .
i end with say i 'm not all so happy about the " company obama keep " either .
i convince her , but my conviction on this be shallow .
she and i be both in despair about obama for reason already well discuss on a2k re his get along mode .
i 'm not sure she be as trouble by u.s. action around the world as i be , but i think so .
i 'm interested in third party maverick , but have trouble envision how that would work out even if i approve of the candidate .
could gary johnson work out ?
huntsman as an independent ?
or , get elect in the first place ?
given a republican in office , one of those in the present batch of candidate , i have more trouble not see thing get worse in some ugly way re the economy and how life would work for the struggle with little income .
i 've despair with president before , though .
so , let say a republican be elect - i can imagine increase polarization in the citizenry as an outcome .
it might result in real change - but in just what way ?
you sound like you 'd rather see that than put up with dem mediocrity any further .
on that , i both see your point and am not there yet myself .
why , i 'll say i fear thing be worse ( to me ) for a while might spiral out of control .
here 's a funny one : when i get a job work for the local college i have to show my birth certificate before they would hire me .
mine have be mislay and i 'd ask if there be any way i could work in lieu of find it , but they say : no they would not hire me without a birth certificate .
but barack obama have yet to produce a valid birth certificate and be no president of the unite state .
not only do it take less paperwork to become president of the unite state than a tutor at a local college , but the us constitution require the president must be a natural born citizen !
without require proof of birth we have waive this constitutional requirement .
@muarck , note : this be not conservative or republican agenda .
i 'm a democrat who vote hillary clinton .
this be just about gross violation of the u.s. constitution .
who be you try to fool ?
obama produce a valid birth certificate .
it be verify by the state of hawaii .
it 's be uphold in numerous court proceeding .
it 's be investigate by just about every news organization out there .
but you do n't have an agenda , yeah right .
a certify copy of a birth certificate issue by the state of birth be valid legal proof of birth , acceptable in a court of law .
no one get their original certificate of birth .
those always stay on file in wherever the state keep their vital record .
obama have show a certified copy .
it 's be examine several time and declare valid .
the state of hawaii have verify the original .
give it up . he 's legal
accord to the ap....here 's a local link
i 've be wonder when that 'd be call !
cnn have both missouri and nc at " 100 % report " but they 're still not colored in .
i be shock that this happen .
i be not unhappy but i be shock .
the tension and animosity on the street in nc be palpable .
i 've be threaten physically twice....like i give a shit....
i do tend to stir the pot i realize .
last night at my gig some drunk late night be discuss what to call obama...bandying the usual right wing talk around and i say " i suggest you call him the motherfucking president elect ".
he be n't sure what to say in response to that so he pay his tab and leave
after last night 's event in brussels , it 's clear that the uk do n't want to be a part of the europe ( or just the eu ? ) anymore .
the continent can cope without the british .
but can the uk go to a prosperous future without the euro , without the continent ?
what alliance be now possible ? just the usa , or the a re @-@ organised commonwealth ?
where will be the future place of this country among europe , russia , china , the usa ?
the uk have say " bye , bye europe ".
i hope they know the mean of " auf wiedersehen "!
@walter hinteler , i can n't remember where i read the analysis , but the conclusion which make sense to me be that currency boundary ultimately imply federal boundary .
to be anthropomorphic , the " uk psyche " resist federal union with europe as evidence by their original reluctance to join the eurozone .
this latest decision be symptomatic of that resistance but economic event will ultimately decide whether " resistance be futile ".
it 's also a sovereignty issue -- and sovereignty be something which the eu have never effectively address .
ever crucial issue be put up for a plebecite , or a vote by nation -- and the population of one or more country , or the government of one of more country , torpedo the deal .
as a " union , " it 's farcical .
not too long ago , when barack obama campaign for the presidency , he be all about human right .
and man do he chastise the republican ' approach to them .
time and time again , obama emphasize ( and i 'm quote from memory here ) that under his rule america would n't lead the world through the example of its power , but through the power of its example .
one of his first act as president be to announce the shutdown of the prison camp at guantanamo bay , which have come to symbolize the bush administration 's fast , loose , and secretive approach to human right .
last week , the obama administration have a perfect opportunity to act on its rhetoric , to set an example of america 's new spirit , to specifically deliver “ change we can believe in ”.
to understand this opportunity , you have to remember that guantanamo bay be just the tip of the iceberg .
the rest of the iceberg , hide underneath the waterline from public scrutiny and media symbolism , exist a system of cia prison in foreign country .
when the cia suspect people of connection to terrorism , it snatch them off the street wherever they live , fly them to those secret prison , and interrogate them .
credible report allege that the cia use torture to extract information from them .
( i 've write about one of the victim a little over three year ago ) .
when some of the victim be try to pursue their case in federal court , the bush administration try to throw out their case on a theory about government secret .
obama , consistent with the rest of his human right rhetoric , sharply criticize bush for it .
but now that bush 's secrecy theory be before an appeal court , obama be change his mind .
without qualification , he be now stick to the bush position that torture victim cannot sue the cia , because the torture be a state secret .
“ change we can believe in ”?
yeah right .
that be so a year ago !
it 's what most politician would do...but still...sigh .
the hell of it be to whom do we turn .
the bush and regan policy that have put us in this position ?
we all vote for obama because of these policy but where do we turn to really gain a government of the people for all the people .
democrat , republican , all i see be crook politician who be only interested in thier own gain and screw the rest of us .
well it be n't just campaign promise , he repeat it in his inauguration , when he already have the presidency in hand .
" we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideal ."
apparently he be miss some qualifier , so i 'll fix it for him :
" we sometimes reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideal when it be politically convenient ."
yeah , i just see this for the first time too .
do n't look good , but i do n't know anything beyond what 's here .
thomas -- when 's the last time you see me say anything about obama , yay or boo ?
i 'm still in politics detox mode and still just not follow this stuff .
also just plain not on a2k much .
this happen to be recently reply to when i check in just now .
i wonder which couple of year he be referring to .
the power of propaganda .
even half @-@ way intelligent people just automatically repeat this propaganda that 's be drive into their head .
interest use of subject @/@ object pronoun .
i have be busy the last few day .
today be the first i hear about the story on npr .
i admit i do n't know the fact but on it 's face i disagree with the decision .
it 's 4 day old ?
it certainly have n't make it into my paper unless i skim over it .
gush like teenager about their first crush ? i do n't gush thomas .
this be n't really an endorsement of torture and rendition , be it ?
with nothing to go on except the link to the nyt article , it look more like there be n't go to be legal action against cia and the unnamed boeing subsidiary for activity they be assure be legal at the time .
i never feel oblige to report every screwup make by the previous administration .
there be so many better qualify people to handle that .
i 'm very close to break point ,
i 've love the same girl for about six year .
i 've kept it to myself forever , then tell a friend a few month ago cause i just could n't cope anymore .
then a week 1 @/@ 2 ago , i declare my love for the girl in a text when i be drunk .
she eventually reply a couple of day later be unbelievably kind about it , which have really just make me fall even deeper ( if this be possible ) .
i tell her she would n't hear from me for a while , you know , so i can attempt to move on .
so now i 'm at the start of the move on phase , but i 'm just stuck .
i cut off most of my hair and i 've start exercise and change my diet to try to alter the chemical in my body to make me feel better that way , but do n't seem to be work , i 'm still miserable .
a song about love will come on my itunes ( pretty much every song in the world ) or a song that remind me of her , and i 'll just break down .
i feel like just drop out of uni and get on a flight to australia and never come back .
during a really low point last week i cut myself ( which i have n't do in year ) just because i have so much pent @-@ up emotion , i have to let it out somehow .
i really do n't know what to do or how to help myself be happy again .
people say time be a healer but i do n't know if i 'll be able to hold out that long !
find activity to occupy your time .
there have to be something you really enjoy do ?
set some goal for yourself . i.e.:
- go to the gym 5 time a week for an hour a day .
- read x book in a month .
- platinum all the god of war game .
- meet one new person a day and engage in a meaningful conversation .
- learn a new skill ( could be play an instrument , draw , try a new sport , web design , etc.).
just some example .
find an activity you like , set some goal , stick to them .
the key be to occupy yourself and meet new people .
maybe make a new playlist on itunes for starter , with happy music . ' don't stop ' by fleetwood mac , etc.
thing that do n't make you think of her .
try , like /\ /\ suggest , get a hobby , go to the gym etc.
it won't be easy , but it 's just one of these thing in life .
try count all the thing that you do have in life ,
sure you might not have her , but i 'm sure you have a number of other thing .
you 're in uni arn't you ? ?
well , a large percentage of the population do n't have that , and i 'm sure you can finish the list .
it might seem impossible at the moment , but pick yourself up and live life with as much energy as you can .
talk to people on here be always a place to start , have make some wonderful friend on here
turn to religion .
when i be in your exact same position i turn to religion and islam have work very well boost up my self @-@ content .
i really like this girl and she 's in a few of my class at university .
everytime i look at her i find her look banck at me .
regardless i do n't know her that well but i fancy her a lot .
i be go to ask her out but for the past few week i 've be wait for the right time ( which never come , partly coz i 'm scared ) .
but be valentine day , should i ask her out and give her a card , or would that be cheesy .
maybe i should just wait for valentine to go .
i see her tomorrow and i could approach her .
i sometimes worry what her mate will think of me , i do n't know i 'm nervous but it have to be do so i can move on i guess
forget about the friend ; if she 's a nice girl , go for it !
be casual , as you run the risk of come on too strong if you do anything seriously valentine 's @-@ y .
i would suggest wait until thursday or so ( let the v @-@ day aura float by a bit ) , and then ask her if she 's get plan sunday afternoon for coffee .
low pressure , maximum talk time .
good luck !
well , in my estimation , while it be " romantic " to ask on valentine 's day , it 's also high @-@ pressure .
it 's your decision , obviously .
either way , coffee date ( or something similar.)
and do ask !
ask as soon as you can manage to get it off your chest .
ask my girlfriend what fantasy she want to indulge in , turn out she want to have a threesome with a lesbian @/@ bi friend of hers that 's want to **** her for age .
and yes the third party be fit and have let my gf touch her before .
my girlfriend be straight but she get a kick out of pleasuring people , if that make sense .
i 'm really kind of split on the issue tbh , i do n't have much experience with this sort of thing , if i be in a no @-@ string relationship they would be no stop me , but i can n't help feel that go through with it would spoil thing between us .
but then again we 're young and it be something i 'd like to kick off the bucket list , as it be .
anyone have any experience with this before ?
good or bad ?
what should i look out for/ be careful of , really do n't want to ruin thing with my girlfriend , but the idea of a threesome be thrill , not gunna lie .
not really , threesome in relationship can really cause issue ,
not to mention the reality be oft very different from the fantasy .
im sexually open mind but theres no way id share my gf with a boy or girl .
if im single yeah sure , attach no way .
if my gf suggest it id tell her no , straight out .
sorry but i dont share .
oh and ive have threesome before someone say it - both mmf and ffm
if you be n't plan on be with this girl forever then go for it .
if you 're engage or some **** then best not to .
if her friend have want to ' f**k her for age ' i doubt it will end well
apparentley threesome can really ruin relationship , as they can make people insecure and unconfident .
fantasy be sometimes better than reality .
if you have any insecurities at all , then i would recommend you not do it .
like people have say , in theory , it 's great .
in reality , thing be a lot more complicated .
i 've be with my girlfriend for well over a year now , and i 'm quite selfless towards her .
i do everything i can to make her life easier and better , and we both love each other .
it mean that i spend generously if need and put a lot of time and effort into the relationship .
however , the other night , i bring up " the future ".
as in , think about where we 'd be a couple year from now and how serious she be about stay with me .
turn out , that she do n't really like me that much when we start date and she be just see how thing go ( although now she say she be very happy , but surprise , that she have stay with me this long ) .
i ask her what she think about where we 'd be and she say she do n't want to think about that , and that i should be happy about the experience we 've have ( which i be ) .
my issue be that , should i continue put so much effort into her if it just seem like i 'm " what 's good right now " for her , although it seem as if she do n't want to make any plan or even hope to stay together for a long time .
it just seem unfair that i 'm put in a lot more effort into this relationship and that if we do break up , she 'd have gain a lot more than i do as a result .
any thought ?
in your situation i would say enjoy the moment you 're in now .
currently i 'm on the fence in regard to get more serious with a guy who be technically still marry , have two children and have openly tell me do not want to get marry again or have any more kid .
if you ever find yourself in a situation like this think about the future early on be a must in my opinion because there be a lot more at stake .
my boyfriend have one of those job where he 's on call a lot .
this year he 's on call for our anniversary .
this happen a lot .
he say we 'll not make reservation but we will make plan etc but not to bank on it .
i 'm not angry at him @- i 'm in uni and i know how it be for thing to change suddenly .
but i need to find a way to cope with this .
if i get all dress up and sit wait , he often text me say he have to cancel .
the disappointment be horrible .
if i do n't get ready , he come home and i 'm in my pjyamas , not shower or ready in anyway .
it ruin the night because i have to run around and get ready and i do n't get to do any of the thing i want to .
be there anyway to
bless you i know where you 're come from .
my boyfriend be a bobby so he often have to stay late because of a job , he 's be hour and hour before get back .
it make it harder because we 're in an ldr so we have little time together anyway and with me at uni and him with only two day off a week now in comparision to the three @/@ four it 's hard .
i do n't think you can not get disappoint .
the job demand it .
i realise that and sound like you do too but it do n't make it any easier .
it 's just something we have to deal with .
value the moment you do get to spend together , try not to plan thing in advance if thing be likely to cancel but be prepare for a bit of spontaneity , maybe have an outfit already in your head you could wear at last minute ?
it 's frustrate , you 're not alone in feel the way you do .
i 'm study abroad for a year and my boyfriend be go to come visit me a few time time .
should i pay for some/half/any of his plane ticket ?
i feel bad when i have all this spare loan money and he 's have to save up for week to come see me , which be something we both want .
what do i do ?
i 'd discuss it with him -
i do n't do abroad , but when my ex and i be apart he 'd pay for his ticket and i 'd pay for everything whilst he be stay at mine -@ food , transport etc ( when he let me anyway ) .
so really it depends on how much the ticket be cost .
i guess as he 's have to save up that live cost wont cover it .
i 'd suggest either half , or if it make him feel less bad about it , alternate - so he pay for the first trip , you pay for the second etc.
when i live abroad my boyfriend at the time would pay for his flight
( they be n't much luckily ) and i would pay for most of the stuff when he be there ; eat out...etc .
so my life 's be quiet now for a pretty long length of time...
i'v have the occasion of see guy , but it never end good or last long .
since november last year i havn't be in a proper relationship and life 's get a bit too quiet for my like .
i can n't seem to meet any new genuine guy .
their all ' manwhores ' to put it bluntly .
some that i meet , i 'll be physically attract to them..but they have no personality to them..you could say their like male barbie doll .
however , some i will meet who have such a lovely personality , but i wont be attract to them physically .
i can n't seem to find someone with that ' connection ' if you know what i 'm say .
im start to feel like it 's me who be the problem .
i can n't seem to find anyone who be n't just interested in sex...
advice please ! ?
use your gold digger ability and find a rich man .
meh i have the same problem just in reverse .
it do get a bit demoralising sometimes when everyone around you be in a relationship , especially now which be probably the worst time of year to be single .
i would n't blame yourself though , you probably just have n't have an opportunity come along .
i 've meet plenty of nice girl at uni but it take a lot for me to actually develop feeling for someone , and i can n't say i 've meet anyone who i genuinely have feeling for .
i 'd rather wait until i do then find a girlfriend for the sake of it - try and think of thing that way ?
just have to keep put yourself out there i guess , if you 're constantly meet new people or get better acquainted with people you already know , an opportunity will come up eventually .
theres a fair chance you 've catch someones eye already and they 're keep quiet about it
so me and my ex broke up about 2 and a half month ago .
do n't know how it all happen but she say she 'd like to see me during the christmas holiday .
now i have this weird thing go on with this breakup.. for the first 2 week i feel totally heartbroken , then i be get on good for a while , then go back to be really sad , etc.
before i come back i feel like i be over it ; then i come back , and suddenly , yet again feel unhappy .
it 's really goddamn annoy .
either way , from what i 've heard , she be n't really the same kind of person she be when we be together ( in a good way for me ; apparently like the kind of girl i 'm not interested in ) , so meet with her might totally kill whatever residual feeling there be and i can get on with my life .
or it won't work and i 'll spiral back into sadness .
or we may get back together , since she tell me she might feel differently in the future . ( ie , want me back , after a break that 's less ' stressful '; not that we ever have a stressful time.. ) .
i do n't think this be ideal , but i 'm an idiot . i know i still feel kind of possessive over her..
i hate the thought of her with another guy .
so should i meet with her ? or not ? or delete her out of my life entirely ? or what..
depending on what you want .
if you want her back , do it .
if you want to be over her , do n't go .
i would say 90 % chance that will end up feel even more sad than you be if you go see her , coz feel do n't just die in 2 month ( unless there be nothing at the start ) .
i meet up with my ex after 2 year of no contact at all and still feeling come back .
so yeah , do n't fool yourself . whatever that girl be do now be probably just a pretend , try to move on , be a change person , ect ect .
do n't expect to feel nothing when you see her .
ok its very important to know this quote : " once a girl leave her boyfriend , the only reason she might wanna be back be to hurt her bf "
dude , do n't meet up with her even if you love her to death because once you have break up , there be no way back and all this meet will do to you be to make you feel upset afterwards .
i be in the similar situation couple of momth ago and i just keep this girl away from me and you ought to do the same since once something be over , then it be over
i really need advice .
me and my boyfriend start date when we be 16 , and we 're now at uni still go out .
he 's always be the sweetest guy , i mean really nice and funny but these past few month thing have change .
he 's have problem at home lately , and thing have be really tough for him .
im surprise how well he deal with it all .
but recently i 've learnt not to bring it up in conversation or he 'll get really angry about it .
i do n't want to go into detail but lately he 's be get agry at the slightest thing , and if i can n't calm him down he 'll get violent especially after a drink .
he 'll always laugh it off afterwards as if he didnt mean it , and i know he doesnt because he be a good guy .
i 've try talk to him about it several time , tell him i 'll leave him if he do it again but it hasnt stop , and he have such a hold on me i dont think i could never leave him .
im so emotionally drain and dont want any friend to know because they 'll just think bad of him , when really he be good deep down .
sorry for the ramble , i just need to get that out .
i 'm post anonymously because what i be go to say be very personal .
just over two year ago my girlfriend step @-@ father be hurt her mum .
my girlfriend go to help her mum and in turn be hit over the head by a glass bottle . as you might expect the police be call and the prick be arrest .
he appear in court the next day and plead not @-@ guilty to assault her mum and assault her to her injury ( serious assault in scotland ) .
now this be where my story get really sick .
i type this and i be full of rage .
my girlfriend mum write to the court and ask for her husband bail condition to be drop as well as for the charge to be drop .
she tell the court not to write to her at her own address or phone her home - this stopped my girlfriend from find out what her mum be up to .
in scotland , domestic abuse charge be not drop if a victim request for them to be drop .
though the bail condition be drop by the high court in edinburgh - this allow the cowardly little prick to contact my girlfriend , her mum and enter the family home .
we find this out on december 23 rd 2009 at about 7.30pm when her mum phone her to say her husband be back in the house and want to talk about what happen .
we phone the police because as far as we be aware bail condition be still in place .
there be nothing they could do .
her mum kick her out on christmas eve 2009 to allow the prick to stay .
i be rage .
see my girlfriend in tear at 16 year old be absolutely heart @-@ break for me .
i do not know how to help but all i do be worry and worry .
my behaviour start to change , i have recently start a career in the merchant navy but due to stress i start to develop problem .
i be eventually referred to a psychologist by my gp to deal with anxiety .
when the case go to trial , her mother lie and say my girlfriend attack him .
the **** be find not @-@ guilty .
my girlfriend be heart break .
i lose it , i go absolutely crazy .
if my mum have not calm me down then i would be in prison just now .
two year on and my girlfriend have forgive her mum .
they live in a flat and the mum disappear at the weekend - 10 point if you can guess who she go to see .
i have not forgive her mum .
i do not visit the flat when her mum be in .
i have have argument with her mum where i have say some absolutely vile thing which i be not in the least bit proud about .
i have ask my girlfriend to stay with her dad as i still worry .
basically me not like her mum affect our relationship a little bit - if we be ever to take the next step and eventually get marry then i do not know how we would do it , though my girlfriend assure me that we would manage somehow .
i still think about the incident a lot .
what i be try to say be that domestic abuse do not just affect you - it will affect everyone you care about .
please take what i have say to heart and leave this guy .
been with a guy for over 3 year .
he 's be act really weird recently .
he have n't pick up literally 7 @/@ 8 of my call .
have n't return any text either .
i do get to speak to him the last time i ring him ( after him blanking 7 @/@ 8 call ) and i ask him what 's up but he do n't tell me ( this be over a month ago ) .
the fact that its a long distance relationship do n't make it any better .
he do this before once two year ago as well over nothing but i can n't really remember how it proceeded...i guess he just gradually start call again .
apart from this , we have have a very love and almost perfect relationship .
i 'm start to lose trust in him now .
i do n't know if i 'm overreacting , but i just feel really hurt about the way he 's neglect me again and i 'm literally cry as i write this .
i let him get away with it last time but i 've have enough .
i do n't know what i aim to achieve write this on a student forum , but any idea on what should i do ? be it worth end the relationship ?
i do n't wanna ring him any more because i feel insult that he just casually blank my call .
and ask him do n't help either since he 's not gunna tell me .
hmm...good few issue here .
personally , i do n't think long @-@ distant relationship would be successful .
the play hard to get , in reflection to what others have say , be clearly not to way to go , since you 're already live far from each other already .
i think that there 's a range of possibility as to why he 's act this way :
1 ) he 's get something to hide .
if you 're say he act this way before about 2 year ago and then perfectly fine later on , there 's clearly something go on in his mind .
i do n't know if that 's cheat or if there 's something else , but there 's clearly something he 's not share with you
2 ) he 's feed up with the relationship .
3 ) he 's autonomous and need a lot of space .
i 'm exactly the same .
even if it 's a long distant relationship , sometimes receive phonecall ( depending on how often you 'd call him ) could actually affect his perception on how he feel about the relationship .
i think if you be to give him a ' taste of his own medicine ' then effectively you might receive the response you 're expect but i think what 's miss here most be communication .
when you see him next time , do n't criticise or start questioning him .
just express your worry to him and maybe you 'll get something out of him .
edit : i do n't understand the neg .
ok so i be female and like male , always have , obsess with a few male celebs and see myself wth guy .
however occassionally i seem to have feeling for older female but i 'm not sure if they be like sexual feeling and it 's quite confuse .
for the first time there be a female who i like whos quite a bit older and i definitely have feeling .
i know that she be n't straight .
i deliberately try to talk to her and spend time with her even though shes clearly quite a bit older .
perhaps they be more feeling because i look up to the person ?
i 'm really not sure , do anyone have any idea ?
what do this mean ?
it seem strange when i be physically attract to men ?
if you 're physically attract to men and you 're not sexually arouse by her , i 'd say you have your answer there it might be that you get nervous and your heart beat faster because you be anxious to please her , or her opinion of you matter to you ?
if you scour the forum and do a search , you 'll see that you 're not the only one who have ever feel like this about a teacher of the same gender .
i use to - in fact , still ! - attach to female teacher and tutor a lot .
my counsellor have great fun dissect it and tell me how i 'm sexually attract to mother figure , but he be just an arse
i be n't in a relationship with this guy but we 've be see each other .
in first year we be always together in the same group of friends..
it be fine .
now in second year , he 's decide he do n't want to see me anymore .
he want to be ' friend '.
but i know he do n't really want to be friend at all .
i think he 's get someone else.. and that 's why he 's finish it but i do n't really care that he 's finish it .
what i do care about be that i 've be completely cut out .
he life in the same place as me and have n't speak to me once since .
i 've be cut out of night out , get togethers.. etc all because i 'm not see him anymore .
this really upset me , i want to be friend with him and i 'm willing to be but he seem to have cut me out so now i 'm not see other people either
really hate it .
what can i do/say ?
other people have cut me out because i 'm not with him anymore either !
this be what you do :
in future you make your own friend , not someone elses .
this be what you say :
oh well , life 's not over .
my ex cut me out as soon as he get a new gf even though he promise to be friend , and that be 2 month ago
so my best piece of advice be try to move on
its bloody hurtful and hard
at first i spend the first 5 week cryingmy eye out not sleep , then it end up that i feel i have do something wrong and therefore he dump me
he let me blame myself and for week i keep think what if i have say this or done that , and then i find out him and his new gf be togther behind my back and i be nothing to do with it , .
so i think if you have like one other friend go out with them , maybe get a job or hobby and meet new people show him you dont care these boy love to think we be sit at home wait for their text which we might be but they cant know that
i have never do something like this before , but i have nobody to ask/ talk to for advice as i cant tell anybody i know
my ex boyfriend have be with me for about 7 month when he go to uni he cheat on me and dump me .
he be now in a official relationship with the girl he cheat on me with , becuase of this we have no speak since he dump me 2 month ago
it be a very very very bad break up
however when we do break up i be a bit of a idiot and beg him not to leave me becuase i be in love with him ,
however ive be feel ill for a few week and go i go to the doctor she say im potentially pregnant .
im freak out
yes i need to do a test but i dont know when as i cant let anybody find out ,
also i feel i cant tell nmy ex as he think everything i do be for his attention to gain him back ,
if i tell him i might be pregnant he willl assume im lie to break up him and his new gf which im not but i dont know what to do
im scare and i dont know how i can tell hiim without him accuse me of be a liar .
she say you 're " potentially pregnant "?
what kind of a doctor would say that without give you a test ?
do a test and get it all over and done with
how about you do a test first and then think of the how to approach it ?
...take it from one who know , no doctor be go to tell you that you might be pregnant , and then send you home to deal with it .
i do n't understand why you have n't do a pregnancy test .
they only cost about £3 or so .
get on and do it and then sort yourself out .
go straight to the doctor .
like get up and go now .
they 'll give you another test just to make sure ( however pregnancy test be rarely wrong when they read positive ) .
they will discuss your option with you and probably direct you towards some people who can give you counsel if you ask .
your option be obviously : termination , continue with pregnancy and have the child adopt , continue with pregnancy and keep the child .
first off , it 's best that i explain that i 've barely any experience with girl .
i 'm in my second year of uni and i , um , ' open my account ' in the sexual world the other night with a girl at my student union .
we 've meet a few time before and have quite a few mutual friend , so she be n't a complete strange .
went back to hers for the night ( she choose that location because she have lecture the follow morning ) and think i handle the actual sex relatively well...
the problem i have lie in the aftermath .
i can be pretty insecure at time ( it 's a wonder i actually make it back to hers , because i be worry i be impose too much ) , and when i wake up i panic and say i have to go and get some work done ( which i genuinely do , although think back on it , it be a weak reason to leave ) .
she decide not to go in for her lecture ( which i eventually realised be probably a hint for me to stay for a bit ) and we have a pretty friendly chat whilst i collect my phone , key etc. together .
she even ask if i want her to come back to mine , but i refuse and say something stupid like ' nah it 's okay , have a lie in ', which i 've be kick myself for .
i just get myself into a panic and have a mental block .
so i leave , and sent her a light @-@ hearted text a couple of hour later apologising for leave so hastily and hope that she have a good night... and do n't get a response .
from here , i do n't know where to go .
to her , i probably come off as someone who do this all the time , and she be just one girl on a list of dozen i 've have one night stand with .
i just feel like i be a bit clinical and almost rude , especially with her ask if i want her to come back with me .
all i want to do now be somehow show her that i 'm not an absolute prick , without seem too desperate or clingy .
i realise the error of my way , and have beat myself up over it massively ever since i leave hers...
i do n't think it 's a completely irretrievable situation , because she 's genuinely a lovely girl , and i reckon i can convince her i 'm not the womanising idiot she ( probably ) think i am... but my lack of experience with girl leave me with no idea what to do .
help , please ! ?!?
i see what you mean .
i 'd suggest give her another text ask perhaps to meet up - cinema , dvd , or grab a coffee @/@ lunch before lecture or something .
if she ignore this too then just move on to the next
then again , she mightn't want anything serious , so just go slow .
just text her and invite her to go out .
to clarify be you just look to ' have fun ' with the girl , or be you cool with the idea of go a little serious ?
i get the impression she like you and be maybe look for something a little bit serious than occasional banging..
i 'm not really sure , to be honest .
i kinda wanna take it one step at a time .
ask her out for a cuppa could be a good idea , although i do n't want to do that just as a way of say sorry .
i 'd rather clear the air first and show her that i know i make a mistake before get into anything else with her .
you complete bloody numpty
you have learn a valuable lesson
i 'm scared as to how he might react and it 's be 4 week and i 've still not find the perfect moment to tell him .
also i 'm afraid what if he do n't want to keep it when i really do .
although he 's a couple of year older than me ( 19 ) , he can act really immature , aggressive , and violent at time .
my parent have come to term with it now after have little mini heart attack , it 's just how can i break it to him ?
i think you should break it to him gentally .
make sure your have a proper convo like one on one and eye contact , then break it to him .
remember it will be a shock to him but hopefully in the end he will pull though and surport you .
i do n't think there be a way to tell him other than just be straight to the point .
regardless of his reaction or personal feeling about pregnancy or abortion , he have a right to know .
talk to him about what you want to do and what he would like to happen .
if you agree , great . if you can n't then talk to your parent might be the next best thing .
well he ask you to get the morning after pill , do you say you would ?
if you agree to take the morning after pill but do n't then that 's quite unfair and he will be annoy .
it 's obvious he do n't want a baby because he be use contraception and even though it fail he do say he want you to take the morning after pill , so do n't be surprise if he do a runner .
you just have to be honest with him and hopefully he will take care of his responsibility .
you say your mum know ?
well break the news with her by your side then , hopefully your boyfriend won't get violent or anything .
give him time to digest the information .
it will come as a shock , particularly if you think you 'd play it safe .
i know you say you do n't think you could have an abortion , but it 's important to talk thing through with him and decide what 's best to do for both of you and , most importantly , for the baby .
yeah i 'll tell you guy tomorrow i 'm just afraid as he 's prone to act violent at time .
+ he tell me to take the pill and i do n't and he 's gonna be like ' wtf there 's no way i can support a child at 19 and that you should n't be have a kid as you 're not even 18 yet blah blah blah '...
so i 'll just tell him he do n't have to be involve with our child financially and i just want him to be there for it as a fatherly figure ( which i doubt he can commit to ) as my parent can support us anyways .
this be go to sound harsh and i understand it be your body , but i be go to be brutally honest .
get an abortion .
firstly , you may want to keep it , but think about it in the long run .
what kind of life will the baby live ?
you be still a kid yourself , around 16 @/@ 17 i would assume .
i doubt you will be able to give it a good life .
also your boyfriend .
i doubt he will be happy and most of the time , boy in this situation will bail .
he be 19 , i doubt he have any long term plan to stay with you .
by keep the baby you be pretty much be selfish .
yeah its your body , but there be 2 people you need to think about :
1. the baby . i can almost guarantee you will not be able to give the baby a good life because of how young you be , and i doubt the father will stay .
2. your boyfreind . he be 19 , you be drag him down for life at such a young age by keep it .
actually 3 people .
yourself . you may end up regret it in the long run .
have a baby be a huge responsibility .
this be child have children .
do everyone a favor and have an abortion .
harsh but true .
you will just end up add to the long and miserable statistic .
edit : cant believe i be actually negged for this . truth ****ing hurt .
i 'm confuse , i love him or i think i do so why am i turn off him now ?
he admit to me that he be bisexual we be talk about ex 's and he tell me about one ex who be another guy .
i be shock and ask him why he do n't tell me before , he say he do n't see a reason to tell me because he like me a lot .
he should have tell me , i 'm turn off at the thought of him with other guy and be sexually attract to another guy .
will this feel go away or shall i break up ?
do n't feel guilty for feel like that .
nothing wrong with be bi , but just as bi 's have a taste for guy and girl , some people do n't have a taste for bi 's , if you know what i mean ?
if you 're really into him stick around , maybe it 's just the shock that 's make you feel this way .
maybe wait a few day and see how the news settle with you before make a decision ?
everyone have a past , to judge him on his would be unfair if you love him .
but if it turn you off or you can n't come to term with it then its probably best to break it off .
either way , give yourself a few day to think about it first if you 're not sure .
i 've suffer with excess body hair since i be young , and i be bully because of it through primary @/@ secondary school and now be unable to wear tshirts etc in public because of how paranoid i be about it .
i go to the doctor because of it when i be around 11 , and they do a blood test but it come back normal so i assume i do n't have pcos .
i have very hairy arm for a girl , not thick hair like a male but lot of very noticable , dark and long ( i bleach regularly but it only last a day or two before the root be noticable ) .
i have never shave them because i shave my leg and get terrible ingrown hair , even though i moisturise @/@ exfoliate etc.
i 've try wax but it only last 2 day before the hair begin to grow back , so it 's really not worth it .
anyway i check out review and after shop around i decide to get the £350 boot smooth skin plus intense pulse light permanent hair reduction machine .
the review be on the whole very good , it come with 20,000 flash ( it take between 70 @-@ 100 flash to do my arm each time i think ) and you need applicator gel which be £3 .
it appear to do exactly the same thing as you would get in a laser clinic , but cheaper and mean i will be able to target any miss hair you might get go to a clinic and it 's obviously private/convenient .
the sale assistant in boot be very helpful , and assure me i could get a no @-@ quibble refund if i find it do n't work but she assure me it will .
i 'm go to use it on my arm first of all , because this be the area that affect me the most confidence wise , but will gradually move on to other area .
for permanent hair reduction i will need to use the machine once a week for between 6 @-@ 12 week ( although i will probably need 12 week ! ) and will start use it tonight .
i 'm quite sceptical over whether it will work but because i 'm confident i can return it , i think it be worth the risk .
i know other girl on here have the same issue with excess body hair , so will monitor the hair reduction over the 12 week course to let you know how it go incase anyone else be think of buy one
week 1: shave my arm and zap them today , do it in two separate go ( take around 30 mins to do each arm ) and my sister do them for me just because certain angle be tricky to get to .
on a pain scale i 'd give it 2 @/@ 10 ( just feel like a hot , tingle sensation for about 1 second then fade ) .
will update what the regrowth be like next saturday .
week 2: had to shave my arm again last night all over , hair regrowth not as course or fast as expect but still widespread .
just finish zap them again but this time do it myself , find it to be much quicker .
i be think of buy one of these because i just think it would be the best thing ever to never have to shave my bikini area again !
let us know how you get on !
if this work well i would definitely buy one , i hate shave and my arm be quite hairy as well ( i do n't shave or bleach them but i be self conscious ) , so i 'd love to be hair free forever .
please let us know how you get on
thank for do this , op.
i 've be debate whether to get one of these machine too .
i really hope it work for you .
i hope it work too !
i suffer from excess body hair and would love for a machine that could get rid of it !
be there any way you can use this kind of thing on your face ?
i assume goggle would be necessary but it would be really nice if it be possible .
i have be look both at this and the phillips lumea , which be a little more expensive , but i keep think it 's too much of an expense for something that i 'm not 100 % sure will work .
look forward to hear what your result be like for this , as i 'd love to be able to buy something that would mean i would n't have to shave every two day in the summer !
without any cosmetic enhancement .
tip ? hint ?
in an ideal world i 'd like to hit a 8 @/@ 10 .
i ask this because i want to start ' mingle '.
i 'd like to look like ' something special ' for once .
style your hair and cloth help a lot .
a bit of make @-@ up , almost every girl wear make @-@ up .
some nice accessory would help too .
dye your hair a ridic colour .
wear really weird earring .
wear clash colour !
bright red ( or orange , or any colour , if you 're confident enough ) lippy .
im really pale and sick of use fake tan...coming out patchy and smell like curry be awful !
i have load of freckle over my body so it doesnt even look nice natural !
i want to start use sunbeds...not to often but just to build a nice natural tan !
but when i go on holiday i burn really easily so i be wonder whether i would burn if i go on the sunbeds or if i build it up it would be gradually get my skin to go tan ?
do n't use sunbeds .
pale freckly skin be lovely , and sunbeds be really dangerous and just not good for you .
sunbeds be very dangerous , especially with regular use and for people with naturally pale complexion , and you say you have ' freckle ' all over your body .
some of these may be mole and so it 's just not safe .
invest in a proffessional fake spray tan - there be more and more salon .
or just be pale and beautiful as i be
i be so confuse and annoy !
my mac nc55 studio fix fluid be perfect for my face a couple of month ago but now my face look dull and...muddy/ashy ?
also my face and chest have a ridiculous colour difference .
i googled nc45 just now and the girl actually look around my skin tone :/
be it possible to go from nc55 to nc45?
my problem be where i should match my foundation to .
my face be medium , my neck slightly dark and my chest so pale ( compare to face and arm ) it 's unbelieveable .
i would actually call my chest an nc 44 .
so what do i do ?
i feel i would look ghostly if i use nc45 but then my chest and face would be the same , help !
yes i have to different mac foundation because my skin change all the time .
i would suggest go to the counter and ask them to match you again .
someone say that nw30 @/@ 35 be meant to be a good shade for ( brown/black ) people who find themselves change shade
if you match it to your chest would n't your neck look weird though ?
i would always say to match to your face as your natural colour will always suit you best .
i 'm very pale caucasian and my chest be dark than my face , if i be to match to my chest i 'd just look a bit mucky , like i have n't wash in week , and i think that if your foundation do n't completely blend into your natural skintone along your jawline you can look like you 're wear a mask .
i recommend get colour matched to your jawline and then adjust with bronzers/highlighters .
i get my nose pierce a couple of week ago with a stud .
it 's not a bone so it be literally just a stud , similar to earring .
because of this be fall out all the time as theres nothing inside to keep it in place .
i want to change to an l @-@ shape stud , but i 'm worry it won't go in easily because i 've have it pierce with a straight stud .
any advice ?
why the hell do they pierce you with a straight stud ?
go back to the piercer and ask for it to be change or find a piercer who will , they should be able to swap it without any fuss .
i have mine pierce with a straight stud , it be flip awkward .
do n't do what i do though , and change it before the 6 week or whatever , as you will probably get an infection which come up as a nasty wart thing on your nose . d :
the l @-@ shape stud be different to put in to the straight one , but if you get the technique right , once you do it correctly , you can do it again .
you put the first bit of the l shape in the hole , make sure you can feel the tip of the end on the inside of your nose .
then press firmly , twist slightly upwards and it should slide in .
if you still have trouble , just go see the piercer and they 'll put it in for you
i notice i be get these permanent forehead line and that my face be a bit dry .
i decide to use some moisturizer and its help .
do many other guy choose to moisturize ?
i use clarins for men :-)
the daily wash on my face , the exfoliating scrub twice a week , and the anti @-@ shine moisturiser on a daily basis ( at least ) .
i have try the cheaper brand , loreal and nivea , and i think they make my skin feel worse .
i use cheap generic moisturiser after shave because my skin get dry and sometimes tender after shave .
i only do it after a shave because otherwise the facial hair stop it from melt into the skin properly .
any moisturiser label as ' aftershave balm ' or ' aftershave lotion ' or ' for men ' etc. be just a big rip off .
it be exactly the same stuff as cheap moisturiser but it be market towards meathead guy who think that moisturiser be ' liek so gay '.
nivea aftershave lotion be around £3 @-@ 5 for a tiny 100 ml bottle wheras you can get a big 500 ml bottle of generic stuff for about a pound that have exactly the same effect .
this be just the modern day version of the old ' mansize tissue ' market one @-@ two .
" oh , it have the word ' man ' in it so it be n't gay anymore "
i have grade 2 acne and it be particularly bad when i ' overwashed ' so i be compel to wash less and to start moisturising ( nivea : dry skin , after wash or shave ) in my late teens .
i also use moisturising shower gel or i get bacne , nice
result be my skin be smoother than it be on some teenage girl ! -
go down well with the lady and i look a lot young than my year , though that 's probably more to do with genetics eh
anyone else get one ?
i be very impress after last month batiste fiasco...
i get the ciate nail polish in kitten heel ilamasqua sheer lipgloss in explode nouveau strip lash weleda pomegranate regenerate body oil and xen @-@ tan deep bronze luxe .
what do you all think !
i think that be well worth £10 .
sound good .
i like the idea of the glossy box and be go to sign up a couple of month ago . but i be worry incase i end up with a load of stuff i just wont use .
the xen tan sound good !
i want to sign up but i 'm worry i 'll get a load of rubbish too :/
i try to order a maxi dress online last night from jane norman , but when i enter my detail , i be told the order have n't go through .
so i try inputting my detail twice more , to no avail....
so imagine my horror to see that i 'd be charge three time for an item that have n't go through ? !
have anyone be in a similar situation ?
if so , how do you resolve it ?
any help would be appreciate
i read here somewhere that jane norman have go bust ?
i do n't know if they be just close the store or both but i think you should see if they have a number you can call .
i would also call your bank .
i just shave all my hair off and i 'm feel good .
i think i might buy a lace front wig tomorrow though .
my hair be badly damage , it 's something that have to be do , it feel so weird .
i 've always want to do this but never have the courage .
congratulation !
i too would buy a lace front wig if i do it but they 're so damn expensive and time consume to put on .
i do not know whether to buy a foundation primer - they be very expensive , be almost the same price as the foundation ( for example laura mercier foundation primer ) .
are they actually worth it ?
do they make a real difference to your skin , or be it just a market ploy ?
do anyone have any they would recommend ?
thank you in advance !
they 're definitely worth it , but i do n't wear a primer every day so i suppose i 'm willing to pay a bit more for them .
i only really wear a primer if i 'm go out .
depends what your skin be like , really .
as a general rule , if your skin be n't totally perfect , or if it 's a bit oily , then a primer be go to make your foundation last a lot long and look a lot better .
i never use to use it , but in the last few week i 've really see a difference .
would you get , or do you know anybody who have get a harry potter tattoo anywhere on their body ?
if you 're confuse ( though i can n't see why you would be ) this be what i be talk about
and there be many , many more...
now , i be as much of a hp fan @-@ geek as the next person , but i would never dream of get a huge hp montage on my body .
imo , while i do love hp and have grow up with it etc. etc. , i know when i be 40+ year old i will look back upon the tattoo and wonder what make me decide to get it .
i can understand why people would want to get it do - it 's declaration of their love for hp and stuff , but i personally would n't ever get a harry potter tattoo .
some small quote @/@ symbol do n't look too bad , but that 's just because i can appreciate the sentiment behind it .
but , while i think they do look pretty cool on other people , i know it be just a phase for me and that 's why i would never have it do .
any think or opinion ?
have anyone actually have one done or be think about get one done ?
it 's your body , up to you what you put on it .
sure you will get some funny look and people will judge you .
kind of like those twighlight tattoo 's middle age women get , i find that more disturbing than young people get hp tattoo 's - they will probably look back when they be 30 @/@ 40 @/@ 50 and remember their childhood .
yet these people who get the tattoo 's aged 30+ already.... that 's another story .
yeah , i mean , it 's one thing to proclaim yourself as a fan of harry potter , and another thing entirely to parade around as poster for it
tbh , most of what people get be just for the sake of get a hp tattoo , not necessarily because of the mean or symbolism behind it...
never.. they do realise that in 50+ year time , they 're still go to have " expecto patronum " tattoo on them..?
imagine try to explain that to your children @/@ grandchildren " yes , i do get a tattoo of something from a fiction book..."
i would never get it myself , but i would definitely love to meet a person who would and be their friend lol....devotion to the next level
i wonder how outdate we will think harry potter be 50 year time
so after wear glass for about 10 year now , i think its finally time to get contact .
i would seriously appreciate some advise from people who use contact already plz ! !
so there be these asda one which seem to be quite cheap :
and in contrast there be these one that they sell @ vision express :
^^^ be almost double the price .
so my question be :
a ) mite sound a bit stupid but would my vision be better with the more expensive one ?
b ) are the daily one better than the weekly ( as they be cheaper )
c ) say if i do get weeklies/monthlies , can i sleep @/@ go to the shower with them ?
d ) finaly , which shop @/@ website do you recommend and some buy advise would be realy good plz ! !
i 'd recommend go to your optician first , you need to know your exact prescription , and whether anything else need to be look at , e.g. astigmatism , whether you 'd suit wet one or drier lens .
i prefer the daily one , as there 's no hassle of clean and store them .
you can shower in lens , but i would n't recommend sleep in them .
i 've do it a couple of time by accident , and i wake up in pain because they 'd move around back and sort of fold over under my eyelid .
i personally would n't go for the cheapest one .
my eye and my teeth be the only thing i do n't skimp on , because it 's so ridiculously expensive when thing go wrong with them that it 's just better to take very good care of them from the start .
hi all , essentially , i 'm look for a " cover @-@ up " ( for lack of a better word ) i can wear daily .
i be wonder be primer alone suitable for this ?
the thing be i do n't like to wear foundation at all ( my face feel weird ) .
with regard to tint moisturiser , i have benefit 's tinted moisturiser - it 's okay but i prefer to use it for night 's out or special event .
somehow it still feel heavy on my face .
be there a much light tined moisturiser out there ?
any advice or tip for what would be suitable for me to wear and brand ?
i 'd prefer to keep away from foundation if possible .
thank you !
i know what you say about foundation , but try body shop .
it 's really light , then use a powder brush to put a light dust of a press powder .
if you 're just look for a blemish cover , rimmel do a blemish stick which cover a multitude of sin .
make sure you remove any make up with a good non greasy cleanser if you do n't want pizza face
primer do n't usually give any coverage .
tint moisturiser give a little , but imo do n't do much at all and i do n't like the feel and texture on my skin .
i use a stila one as it be ok , but slightly greasy
i 'd just get a really light foundation e.g. givenchy
do you remember that movie that be based on nothern light by philip pullman ?
how come they never make a sequal ?
i be shocked..there be so much hype when it come out...it be so anticipated...x
well in the series of philip pullman book , the next one in the sequence be call the subtle knife , i guess they would make a film of that rather than call it the golden compass 2 .
i imagine they would n't make a sequel because the first film be n't very good .
if they even think of call it " the golden compass 2 ", i will go into genocide mode .
it piss me off enough that they change northern light to the golden compass for no apparent reason as it be , let alone ****ing up the rest of the trilogy .
the film sell well in europe but poorly in america , as a lot of religious group see the film as anti @-@ christian @/@ religion and so it get a lot of bad press .
the american market be what matter ( afterall , they take the american title of the book , not the original title ) , so all plan for a sequel be can .
not to mention that the golden compass strip off all the reference to religion it possibly could , but that 's pretty much impossible in the sequel .
how can you kill god without any religious context ?
so if there be bad press for the first film it 'd only get a million time worse by the time the last film come out .
to many fan it 's difficult to see how the golden compass could 've even carry the series forward since it leave out a lot of the important part of the magesterium that be develop in the sequel .
in short , if there be ever to be a dark material trilogy , it 'll have to be from a british film production company who do n't care what the bible belt think .
it would 've be nice if someone decide to take it on after the harry potter film craze die down , but since it 's be try once and fail i think it 's go to be a good few year ( 10 or so ? ) before anyone think of touch it again .
hopefully if it happen they 'll do a lord of the ring and film it in one big go rather than wait to see if the box office figure validate a sequel . :/
i do n't either but i can see why he 's do it .
cameron be re @-@ release avatar with 6 additional minute of footage .
people might think it 's a waste of effort , but those 6 minute will no doubt bring him at least , a few more million $$$ in the bank , just like this 3d crap will for lucas .
depends on the film , i think it be interest to see avatar in 3d , but no other movie since have interest me in 3d ( harry potter in 3d be a joke )
on the subject of star war , as a massive fan since i be a child this sadden me as i would like the film to be leave as they be . ( say that i do agree with the remastering they do for the 20 th anniversary...)
though be the whore that i am... i will probably splash the cash to watch star war on the big screen again...
hollywood money @-@ grabber cash in while contribute to destroy new technology - shocker .
i also disagree with people who would say " why not ? ".
artistic integrity , for instance .
it would be far more appeal to see those film fully remastered in imax , rather than a tacky bandwagon jump , and it would still rake in money .
the problem be " good " be still a long way off the kind of image audience expect .
without the force , an after @-@ conversion will never even begin to look good .
if you have six film , which be n't release in their in @-@ universe chronological order originally , would n't you want to change it for any subsequent release ?
the prequels would definitely be improve with 3d , because like avatar they 're all about spectacle and explosion and the " plot " be really just there to string the spectacle and explosion along for 2 hour .
you can n't tell me you would n't want to see , say , the open battle in rot in 3d ?
that be awesome enough in the cinema anyway , but it could really be enhance by ilm do their thang .
i be less optimistic about the core film be convince in 3d , because as much as i love their visual effect , they be design 20 year before people even begin talk about the possibility of 3d as it have be realised today .
they have hold up very well because the story and character be strong , not because the visual effect be up to much , revolutionary though they be at the time .
still , this be ilm we 're talk about here , hopefully all six film will come out look pretty good .
however what i really want be a blu @-@ ray collection of all six .
hurry the **** up , george .
have anyone hear of this film ?
it star , among others , natalie portman , vincent cassel , winona ryder and mila kunis .
it have receive some amaze review .
it be go to be officially release here in the uk next year in february , but it be go to be show at the london film festival next month .
i read the screenplay a while ago .
a lot of visual potential but a little weak in the storytelling department .
hopefully aronofsky have be able to turn it around , though i 'm not really dig the trailer - mulholland drive anyone ?
it have mila kunis kiss natalie portman in one scene .
it 's safe to say the film will attract viewer .
id play a video game call the prince of persia but there be already a film come out .
for those , who have watch it . what be the feedbacks ?
plan to see the movie alone
i think it look awful , personally .
i really can n't stand that actress because she play the most annoy character ever , and her character in prince of persia really grate in just the trailer .
not to mention that the script sound horrendous .
i have n't see it though...
i be gonna ask if i be the only one who thought this , but a quick google search of ' sex and the city 2 racist ' answer that question .
was the film racist ?
was it intentional , to add to the vapid ignorance of the character ?
was it intentional pro @-@ american propaganda ?
or be i , and many critic , make something out of nothing ?
thought tsr ?
it be kinda insult to their culture .
but the whole thing be exaggerate for the purpose of enhance the storyline , e.g the clash between samantha 's rampant sexuality and the " cover up " stereotype of eastern country .
i do n't think anybody should get on their high horse about it , people only insult it because it 's sex and the city , nobody give a **** about stuff like that in other film .
i be watch good will hunt and i realised how some of the thing in the film apply to me eg push yourself away from people because you 're scare that they 'll find you imperfection etc.
that really get me think about my life and what i need to change so if you have any film that have change you personally or have make you change your outlook on life then plz share .
if you 're think , think about something useful and interesting which will get you somewhere : maths .
i agree there 's more than education .
if you do n't want to think , you could get waste or do something else etc.
if you 're spend your time think , make it useful think , that 's all i 'm say .
the doom generation . saw 1 , i know a lot of people get hook up on the gore and ' sickness ' of it , but the whole point of that film be philosophy about life and it do get me think for a while .
actually it lead to a lengthy , involve discussion at uni in which someone end up cry . so definitely good for think about life .
and if you 're willing to watch something that be n't a film but still go in the dvd player , then any of the bill hick stuff
if anyone have n't say the blind side yet , then that get my vote !
i see the trailer for it and have yet to see the whole thing , but it look amaze .
and i do n't necessarily think this film be go to make you think hard about life , but.. i also recommend watch brick .
it 's good if you 're into a film noir kinda thing .
cant believe no @-@ one have mention pursuit of happyness , the only time i have shed a tear infront of the tv since see tottenham loose the worthington cup final when i be 9 .
serious stuff , this movie be immense and have affect me more then any other film or tv show .
scrub be pretty good as well as provide laugh .
i dont know if you genuinely believe this or if you be just try to act the adult .
a life have be spent entirely on academia whether it be maths or anthropology at the cost of miss essential human experience be the biggest waste of a life imaginable .
did anyone know ?
imdb page
the film be class comedy @-@ drama and be supposedly about the creator and the found of facebook .
facebook have be around for five year now and the question be , do it warrant a film ?
are the maker hope every facebook user . around 200 million globally will watch the film ?
bit of a stupid idea how film production company will make a movie about this when there a far better movie script out there .
why not make a film about digg ?
that 's get a better found story than facebook .
why be justin timberlake in it ?
are they just try anything to make it big ?
i personally use facebook and think it 's a useful thing to have , but to be honest why would i want to see a film about it ?
i like see comedy , or thriller , or action films.. but a film about the founder of facebook ?
yeah i hear about that about a year ago when it first go into production .
i 'm really interested to see what come of it give the cast and ( especially ) david fincher direct with aaron sorkin scripting ! !!
the academy have announce that they will permit ten nominee for the best film category instead of the usual five .
the reason behind the change be that the academy , in the face of fall rating , want to attract more popularity to the oscars .
what do you think of this change ?
what would you do to make the oscars more popular ?
or do you think the rise of the internet and etc will inevitably slowly kill off the oscars ?
i 'm still fume about shawshank not get an oscar .
similarly , i be still piss that slumdog millionaire be award best film last year .
it be a travesty !
it be good no doubt , but the best ?
the judge panel just jump on the bangwagon surround the media hype .
i think the dark knight should have win the best film award , but they do n't even nominate that film .
out of the nominate one , i think milk be much better than slumdog millionaire .
though frost @/@ nixon be pretty good as well .
( the reader and the benjamin button film be crap.)
so in the last week , the new head of ofsted , sir michael wilshaw , have say : “ all teacher should be qualify ”.
what an absolutely preposterous suggestion !
you mean to say that , as citizen of this great nation , our children should be teach by professional people who have go through the necessary rigmarole to be let loose in our school ?
how dare we expect that from our education system . and while we 're at it - why stop there ?
let 's round up our homeless and get them work in our hospital .
it 'll get them off the street and straight into promising career .
youth unemployment be rife at the moment so let 's get them pilot our aeroplane .
heathrow might even get its third runway so we could do with a few more pilot .
i hear overcrowd in jail be a problem too - especially since the riot last summer .
why do n't we just convert the miscreant to our side by give them a uniform and a gun ?
they 're bound to see sense and start make our street safe instead of cause the trouble .
and lastly , with the easter holiday come up , young children will need something to keep them occupy .
maybe they can try write for a sunday tabloid - i hear there be vacancy at the sun .
you may have sense my slight sarcastic undertone - although that last suggestion might not be such a bad idea .
call me naive , but i always assume that teacher be either qualify or train alongside someone qualify ?
it seem though that any old sod can do it .
be it any wonder then that the uk 's position in the international league table have slip ?
so despite sound incredibly obvious , mr wilshaw seem to have hit the nail on the head .
problem solve .
i 'm sure it come as a welcome suggestion to all the fully train , out @-@ of @-@ work teacher who struggle to get a job .
not to mention the one who have job and have work extremely hard to get there .
so until then - if you 're pass by your child 's school , you might want to pop your head around the classroom door .
just to make sure one of the dinner lady be n't also teach maths .
all teacher should be able to teach .
some piece of paper from a teach academy do not equate to , by definition , be capable of teach .
i think all we need to do be think of some teacher we have have to know this .
and at the same time i think we can all think of great teacher who have not have a piece of paper from a teacher train college .
with this notion of qualification there be an unholy alliance of two group of people .
the first be the well intend sponsor who think enforce such rule will improve education by keep so call unqualified teacher out .
the second be the special interest group , the teacher union , who want to keep competition out so they want a piece of paper that teacher need to have .
this piece of paper be just another barrier to entry for outsider and keep the incumbent teacher safe from competition .
the teacher union hate competition and they have do a very good job of fending off competition under the guise of the public interest
fortunately we have thing like the khan academy now that be go to seriously screw those monopolistic selfish bastard over .
suck on that educational establishment .
this be a story about bnp on dm
http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti....html#comments
unsurprisingly the most liked comment defend the bnp , the rest all praise the bnp , whether it be in a stealthy way or openly ( most of the " best rate " comment openly support the bnp ) .
majority of the " worst rate " comment on that site criticise the bnp .
i conclude that most of the reader of that paper be bnp sympathisers or supporter .
p.s i would have be for the bnp if they just be n't racist or present themselves as a " christian party which support christian value ", some of their policy e.g " get out of afghanistan ", " stop be usa 's poodle ", " kick out muslims who dont integrate ", " eradicate islamic fundamentalism from britian " e.t.c really interest me .
i wish liberal support the policy i mention
while i too think most of their reader be racist , i think for the majority they be more " friendly " racist than " bnp " racist .
by friendly i mean that while they harbour racist view , they be perfectly polite to anyone of any race and do n't go around be openly racist or discriminate against individual .
still not a great quality to have , but nowhere near the level of vitriole as the bnp .
i would n't compare them directly to the bnp - most of the reader be white middle class people who find many of the change in society scary and the daily mail give them stereotype to blame without use too complicated language .
whilst it 's an awful paper , compare its entire readership to some of the monster in the bnp party be wrong .
please post in this thread all discussion relate to the recent rise in tension between the uk and argentina over the issue of the sovereignty of the falkland island .
argentina be grow quite rapidly compare to the uk , but that be beside the point .
if argentina be to launch a surprise attack and take the island 's airfield , then britain would be effectively unable to retaliate due to lack of an aircraft carrier .
keep pretend everything be fine , though .
argentina - yes .
argentina 's arm force - no.
argentina launch a surprise attack ?
well , it would certainly be surprising , not least to the member of their arm force use the same kit they do in ' 82 .
they 'd be astonish to learn that they have suddenly discover the requisite experience , train and equipment to make such a land possible .
not to mention we have the southern hemisphere 's most capable attack aircraft station on the fis .
yes , we 're without an aircraft carrier , mean we cannot retaliate in the same way we do in ' 82 .
however , this do not mean we cannot retaliate .
we 've prove that the typhoon can fly from ascension island to the falklands .
the rn can still launch a task force that would , if allow to fight openly , utterly decimate the argentinian navy and we retain the ability to launch tomahawk directly through ms. kirchner 's window should we wish .
they would have to be suicidal .
pretty cool eh ?
what do people think about in @-@ vitro meat ?
would you eat it ?
as a matter of interest to the vegetarian and vegan out there , if it be n't mix with blood , and be simply stem @-@ cell grown , would you eat it
( i can see why vegan might be oppose , but i 'm unsure about vegetarian )
if it benefit my health then i would probably eat it .
sound interest . though i doubt they 'll be able to replicate the taste of a good bit of beef any time soon .
for fast food place where the meat they use be terrible anyway it should n't affect thing much .
it might be the key to the survival of the human race .
how do vegetarian view this ?
all the thing they could research to do with stem cell and they come up with this ?
time be run out for the chagos islander to return home .
these people be illegally remove from their homeland to make way for the us military base on diego garcia , lease to the us from the uk for a 50 year period , which could be renew for a further 20 year in 2016 , if the us so wish .
i 'd urge anyone to watch this video for deep understand of this atrocity : - http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=1ocqqn_uoiy
if you be short of time please take a few minute to watch this : - http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=qflhb_skmig
after witness these event , i hope us educate tsrians have the view that democracy should prevail , and no one should be forcibly remove from their home .
not many know about these atrocity , but help spread the word .
and please sign this petition to raise awareness , and hopefully ( yes , be very hopeful here ) it will one day be debate in the house of common . http : //epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/4685
thank you .
i sign it .
with all the stuff go with the falklands , i think this make the uk seem a bit hypocritical .
i 'll sign the petition if you remove the highlight part from your post .
it 's inflammatory and a cheap attack on coalition force .
when actual innocent civilian do die it 's regretable , but we both know that they be n't the intend target .
you clearly put that there to win brownie point with the anti @-@ war crowd despite this issue have nothing at all to do with the conflict in iraq and afghanistan and infact bomber operation out of diego garcia completely cease over five year ago .
i happen to watch a news review on sky news this morning in which a bunch of journo 's be bleat on that we should n't condemn all the " innocent " and hard work journalist at news international just because a whole bunch of hack at the sun be arrested...
because that would cause untold damage to the whole media industry .
oh poor them .
this be precsisely , be it not ? , what the whole media have be do to the bank industry for the last two year or so ?
total hypocrisy .
it be important to seperate the innocent from the guilty in both industry but it 's ironic that the paper have be sell copy by basically tar all banker with the same brush and slagging them off mercilessly for year .
isnt sky news own by bskyb which be own by news international or something ?
it doesnt surprise me though , let hope murdoch go down .
the media condemn banker be akin to a witch hunt , stephen hester be give just a £6.5m bonus in 2010 yet jpmorgan 's top executive be pay $ 21m that year .
stephen hester be employ because of his excellent show of skill after his success in safely defuse the explosive capital @-@ market business of abbey national .
the media seem to have mix up the man responsible for the merge with abn amro with the man responsible for fix the failure of rbs .
moral of the story : the media will always present news in a way which forward their view , it 's that simple .
i recently come across two story , one about a pcso in the uk who be arrest and sentence to up to 10 year for have an " affair " with a 12 year old girl , and another where a woman in utah be give up to 15 year for have sex with a 14 year old boy .
for the sake of argument , let say a 35 year old woman be have sex with a 14 year old boy and similarly a 35 year old man be have sex with a 14 year old girl .
i can n't think of a good reason why either of these scenario should be worse than the other , but deep down i seem to feel that the first scenario be n't that serious at all .
in order to give a reason as to why they be different i 'd have to admit a difference in free will between young guy and girl , which be hard to do .
but for some reason it almost seem like the 35 year old man be some sort of predator whereas the 35 year old woman be only misguide .
in keep with this the 14 year old girl be take advantage of whereas the 14 year old boy be lucky .
note that in both case the sex be consensual , obviously not legally , but in the sense that there be n't any physical compulsion .
so i 'm not say if a 14 year boy be forcibly touch by a woman it would be ok .
i have a discussion about this with my girlfriend , she think both be serious .
i agree , but also seem to have this almost sexist view that the boy be really hurt at all .
what do you guy think ?
be it sexism or be sex between teenage boy and older woman just fundamentally different ?
i think it seem less serious because 14 @-@ year @-@ old boy talk about have sex with an " older woman " as if it be an achievement .
whereas to a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl , if an older man be interested in her she 'd consider him a dirty pervert .
therefore it seem unlikely that the girl consent , whereas most would believe the boy would be very much up for it .
well suppose the 14 year old girl feel the guy love her and want to have sex with him .
it still seem that it 's worse because for some reason i 'd think the man have manipulate her in some way whereas in the other case i would n't really feel the boy have be dupe .
i think this be n't a good way to think about it but it seem fairly prevalent .
yes , i see that .
my point be , people would n't believe that . that 's why it seem worse .
girl : " but i want sex with him ! " - most would assume she be brainwash , groom .
boy : " but i want sex with her ! " - most would assume that yes , he probably do .
anyone else think it 's a bit ridiculous that this man actually get arrest for make a monkey gesture ?
it do n't hurt anyone , and whilst it may be offensive to some , surely this be n't an arrestable offence ?
i mean , where 's the line between un @-@ pc and illegal ?
no , i do n't think it be ridiculous .
whilst no one want to stop banter , the intention of this be clear : to cause offence .
it be disgraceful and totally unacceptable .
criminal charge + lifetime ban from all ground methinks .
i 'm a liverpool fan and there can be no excuse for this behaviour .
i hope he be ban from football for life ( not just anfield ) .
i honestly do n't understand racist people .
no he should have be arrest .
i hope the fa ban him from all match for life , and the court give him a suspend sentence and some kind of community service .
what i do n't understand be in the film hot fuzz , one of the detective , who be white , call nick frost , who be also white , a monkey .
now , unless i 'm miss something here , i 'm pretty sure nick frost be n't black , and monkey mean black person , do n't it ?
so what be this detective use the word ' monkey ' for if it be n't to mean black person ?
i 'm terribly confuse .
it 's short but if you do n't want to read it basically a guy in the usa have be arrest for agree to meet up with and have sex with a " 14 year old girl " who be actually an undercover cop...
surely this be entrapment ?
he do n't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation ?
sure , it would be a crime if he have actually do this with a 14 year old and something have happen when they meet up...
but the american police have basically create this whole scenario and lead him into it , feed him along ?
this suggest to me that the police officer be the one who suggest everything...
coax him into it...
we do n't know the full story but i get the impression that this " 14 year old girl " offer him sex on a plate willingly....
would that be legal in this country ?
i mean i think it 's wrong that this guy would meet up with a 14 year old with the intent to have sex...
but fabricate the situation... you can n't arrest someone for something they have n't done... it 's just wrong...
am i the only one who think this be mess up ?
from previous similar story , what usually happen be that the undercover officer behind the screen be extremely passive ( as a normal young innocent teenager would probably be ) and then agree to meet up with the potential paedophile , if he show up at the place then he be guilty .
i see nothing wrong with this morally , he know the girl be 14 and still decide to meet her ( have previously state his intention through im ) .
if that be the case then i understand and agree , it 's just the way the article be write it sound as if the police officer be do a lot of the work , and it 's in america so different law to here .
they do this and it work , there be even a show about it .
to me its fine , if the suspect have to make a choice , ie leave his home and go to a location , then i do n't really care if he be encourage .
not that recent but it have go under the radar for month .
it 's graphic so that be why it be in spoiler .
strange that youtube keep it up , but it 's not horrifically graphic like thing on liveleak .
story be basically that they be targeted for refuse to believe in god @/@ jesus as their saviour .
guess they do n't get the version with the execution part edit out ?
inb4 ''you can n't judge all christians on a remote village in kenya''
i 'm not , i 'm just post it .
what planet be you on ?
go to the gore websites that dont restrict content and you 'll get so many thing about africa .
the majority of the world may be in the 21 st century but that crap hole be still in the dark age .
there 's nothing to stop these people what they 're do , either .
i imagine the town be either under the grip of religion , or too scared to protest simply because of the nature of these punishment .
another bullet point on the big list of thing atheist do n't do .
how christian of them !
it would be a bit silly to suggest only christians have do thing like this .
what do we think ?
will this mean a weak unite kingdom ?
something that struck me watch a question time debate on this issue be the attitude of some english people , such as the obnoxious mail journalist on the panel , that scottish independence be good because then we would n't have to subsidise them for be poor .
he even make some kind of play on word involve the word " skint ".
scotland probably receive more than its fair share of uk government spend in term of its share of the population .
i believe this be because it be , on average , poor than england .
the way some english people sneer at the scots for be poor and therefore receive more government spend would n't , i presume , be direct at poor area of england .
the north , wale , the south @-@ west , east london and many other area of the uk get more than their proportional share of spend , because they need it .
i think it 's wrong to resent the scottish poor for be scottish , because i 'm sure such complaint would n't be make about poor region of england .
i be also annoy by a woman in the audience who say scotland should be independent ( she be english ) because " all country should be independent ", include wale and " ireland ".
this be such a simplistic view .
should yorkshire be independent ?
should flanders split from french @-@ speak belgium ?
should northern ireland join with the republic ?
should quebec be independent ?
should the kurds be independent ?
should bavarian , or basque , or sicilian , or catalan , or bosnian @-@ serbs , or cantonese chinese have independence ?
load of place have their own history , culture , devolved government , language and so on .
just because scotland be an independent state 300 year ago , do n't mean it should be today .
the definition of " country " be more complex than that woman 's personal black and white judgement .
culturally i feel british and i want britain to stay together .
but i recognise there be convince political and economic reason the snp have for independence and i do n't think lord ashdown 's reponse on qt of " we 're stronger together " have enough real substance to it .
i support him , but unionist need to express in more real term why we 're stronger together .
another interest issue be the advantage to the tories if labour @-@ dominate scotland break away .
the mail guy make this point and dimbleby immediately quote number prooving that actually scottish mps have never be significant in the balance of power in the common .
( take that sensationalist journalist who have n't get their fact straight ! )
and then there 's the issue of time .
it may well be tactical on the part of the snp to wait until 2014 , but i think it 's practical too .
who get the trident sub ?
who get the arm force ?
do scotland stay in the eu ?
do it keep the pound ?
what about their oil ?
do the english have a say ?
these be all in my view huge issue .
it 's the biggest decision in 300 year and it need to be make slowly i think .
give the scots two year to make their mind up , because it 's not as simple as the westminster government want to make out .
i do applaud them though for try to get the legal issue sort out .
i be so tire of this debate , but i guess it 's go to keep crop up .
independence would be worse for both scotland and the rest of the uk .
as scots be we really so different that we 'd toss aside the political , cultural and economic benefit of the union so that we can massage our own ego and yell " freedom ! "?
there be an snp canvaser at my door today , so my mum decide to annoy him , and tell him she vote tory... for which he have no response and get all fluster , then when ask which party she would vote for in the next election she say she do n't vote for a party , she vote for a person , and he get confuse , then she say she would n't vote for independence , and he be genuinely surprise and do n't know what to say
the snp seem to think that just because they win the election it mean that the whole country want independence , when actually they probably win the election because they want free prescription , free tuition , free care for the elderly etc. while other party be n't offer as much ( although , it do beg the question of where exactly all this money be come from ? )
now for a bit of intentional controversial and completely ignorant ' tar with the same brush ' type question :
be this what ' british ' people think ?
i know many people do n't think like this bitch but this be appaling .
should she have her kid take away from her ?
you see the other ' british ' woman do n't defend the others but be more concern with have to take care of her baby that be about to wake up , which mean one ' british ' woman be be racist , and the other ' british ' woman be just let it pass , be more worried about something else .
so do that mean that most ' british ' woman think like this ?
you also have to admit that the lady argue with the rave bitch have no reason to say ' we 're here because you do n't work , go find a job ', that 's wrong and a bit racist within itself .
the like to dislike ration on this video be around 3 @:@ 1 , what do that show ?
what do you think ?
if you allow her to have this opinion be it because you project the same feeling ?
what would be the point in argue with her ?
the women be so steep in her own ignorance it would take year to educate her
she 's entitle to her own opinion .
someone should have just give her a slap just to shut her up
wow , she 's gonna be really piss in about 20 year . hahaha !
but seriously , if all english @/@ british people be like her.....why would anyone want to be english/british .
i actually think she have something wrong with her , whether she be on drug or drunk .
but she be slur a lot .
the fact she call nigeria... nygigreeah.... i think she be half with it...
no @-@ one in their right mind , start scream and swear like that , with their young child sat on their lap...
also , to say most british women think the same , be wrong .
i 'm a british woman and would never dream of acting like that .
you say the one other british lady do not stand up for the others , but...
1. she actually do , by tell the loud mouth cow to shut up .
2. although she should n't have to , why do you think she have to get involve ?
just because she be british ?
3. several other people , who be n't british do n't get involved... do that make them racist too..?
4. if i be in that situation , and i have a child with me , i would try my hard not to get involve , as it would n't be fair on my child .
but if the argue cause my child to be disturb , then i would have do the same and get involve .
i agree that what i have watch in this video be sicken , but i disagree with several point you have make .
and i would actually say some of your point be rather racist and offensive to british women .
you may be angry at what you have see , but that be no reason to group all british women as racist .
seem stab be become as regular as fart , soon there will be so many knife on the street it will bring back the uk 's steel make to what it be 50 year ago .
along with tougher sentancing i dont know what else could be do that would'nt upset the bleed heart liberal ( no pun intend )
i would rather be stab by a childish fool than be harass by the police on a daily basis .
edit : i will clarify - i would rather take the risk of be stab than have my freedom infringe on a regular basis .
do u know statistically ethnic minorites be more than likely to be stop and search .
just say that this kind of measure to stop and search anyone @- i do n't really see as appropriate .
recently france decide to ban the burka in public place in the interest of public security .
i both agree and disagree with this statement .
some women feel the burka empower them , but other feel trap by it .
so be it a public security issue or just some anti semetic judgement ?
be a piece of cloth wrong ? in what way ?
intimidate or force one into dress a particular way be wrong .
it have be say that if teenages cannot wear hoodies in shop as it conceal their identity why should somebody to wear a burka ?
i 'm a muslim and i do n't agree with much of what he say , but i can n't deny that he be a fantastic orator .
whether you agree with his view or not , you have to respect the man 's incredible intellect and sharp wit .
i happen to agree with his view on religion and so i must thank him for teach me an incredble amount of factual knowledge but more importantly , the ability to think critically .
i do n't have any johnnie walker so i hope a glass of this jd will suffice .
thank you for everything hitch .
you be truly my inspiration .
i be a hitchens fanboi for a year or so and the fact this be actually really quite upset be a testament to just how good his write be , that he can have such an incredible impact on people life .
even the guy above who be a glad he be dead have be seduce by the hitch 's write in that you either devote yourself to him or hate him above all else .
( that guy be obviously far too stupid to comprehend this though guy so best to just ignore him )
i be n't such a fan of his habit of preach opinion as truth , then again i 'm not a big fan of rhetoric in general .
nevertheless , he exercise his right to freedom of speech to the nth degree and give a lot of people strength in the process .
he will be miss .
a contrarian and freethinker until the end . he leave no one untouched...from mother teresa to bill clinton and henry kissinger .
a fantastic orator , extremely well @-@ read and a sharp wit...
it 's a sad , sad loss .
we need more people that go out of their way to challenge the " false refuge of consensus " he have referred to and warn against seek .
i 'm come across so many good quote from him !
on reagan : " he 's do to the country what he can no longer do to his wife ."
on a tv evangelist : " if you give him an enema you could bury him in a matchbox ."
i may have support his anti @-@ religiousness but , whatever your opinion on it , you have to admire the courage of his conviction .
he only say what he think be right and , if we have more people around today like that ( namely in politics ) , the world would be a better place .
when i hear about his death this morning my mood completely shift .
his writing and speech be such a huge influence on me during those most tumultuous teenage year , the year in which i be " tentatively feel my way into the life of the freethinker " in the word of dawkins , and serve as a brilliant rebuttal to the dogma i be be feed in catholic school .
i have the pleasure of see mr. hitchens at the " great god debate " last year here in boston and in retrospect , i 'm glad i have that opportunity before his untimely , yet nonetheless inevitable demise .
what be the chance that tm when we wake up in the morning , we switch on to the news and see break news that prince philip have die after overnight heart problem
the guy be in his 90 's
what be the chance he survive this so far look very silm
i pray for his swift recovery and many more year of life and service to the uk and commonwealth .
much as i be fond of the royal family if he die i really hope we do n't end up see a load of scene that would not look out of place in north korea and a media circus .
it be about time someone remind all these naive women that no matter what your " right " be , you still have to take responsibility for your safety or sadly face the consequence .
edit : so... 87 96 people would risk be rape rather than get a taxi ?
well do n't come cry to tsr when you get a reality check .
it 's a sad fact of our society that you have to think ahead all the time to ensure your safety .
it should n't be - you should be able to dance down backalleys naked , drunk at 3 in the morning if you want to without anyone try to cause you harm , but unfortunately there be always those who will take advantage , so you should always watch your drink , stay within your limit and never ever wander off on your own .
oh thank lord , someone talk sense .
why be we tell women not to get rape instead of tell men not to rape ?
it 's not like get a taxi be even something everyone can do .
you can n't always afford a taxi ( especially if you 're in london ! ) , you can n't always flag one down , you might not have a work phone on you ( lack of credit , lack of battery ) and you might have a phone but no idea of local taxi number .
do this mean you deserve to be rape ?
obviously not .
the point here should be ' if you see a woman walk alone at night , do n't rape her ' as oppose to ' if you 're a woman , or have any chance of be perceive as one , do n't walk around alone at night '.
it be easier for men not to rape than women not to be rape .
you just do n't rape .
edit : i seem to have be misconstrue by a couple of people here , so i 'll elaborate .
women have a responsibility to mitigate the risk of bad thing happen to them , like any of us .
i be not say that women should realistically be able to dance down back alley naked .
i be say that the only person with the power to eradicate the risk be the prospective perpetrator .
if a girl be rape , it be not her fault even if she do n't take the adequate measure to mitigate risk , because that risk would have be there irrespective of how careful she may have be .
rape victim do not have the power to prevent rape .
only the would @-@ be rapist do .
on that basis , the above interviewer 's handle of the subject seem to me to have be insensitive in the extreme .
women should not be make to feel bad for have be rape .
now if these lot riot and loot be south asians or , god forbid muslims , forum would be fill with anti @-@ multiculturalism rhetoric - where derogative comment about an entire group of people would be acceptable .
often these people would decry the " pc liberal media " for not call it out .
so , we all know the crime problem in the black community in london , why be n't you call it out as an example of multiculturalism fail ?
you 're probably think it , but do n't want to say it .
heaven forbid , have you become politically correct overnight ?
you clearly have n't be on tsr today .
there be have be numerous thread about the black community etc.
it kind of get bore after a while .
they be : i do n't know about tsr , but you should look at the comment on the telegraph website .
mind , they do n't need much encouragement .
why should it be a racial thing .
most of the past riot have be majorly white , nobody start bang on about race then and they should n't .
i 've see a lot of racism today and its unacceptable .
forget about race
found this blog earlier which talk about the need to slow population growth .
the blogger put forward a two child policy as the answer .
any thought ?
the only country that would be able to implement this already have birth rate below replacement ( or will do soon )
the only area of real population growth in the future be go to be africa , and i can n't imagine any african state be able to exert this level of control and organisation on their citizen .
most of the word that come out of his mouth these day seem to be try to lure catholic vote .
it seem that he know under the current population change ( if it continue ) that ireland will eventually unite .
but how can he possibly ' end sectarianism ' if member of his party come out with purely bigotory remark ( such as ian mcmrea 's in the summer time )?
how can he possibly change the mind set of unionist who vote for nationalist party ( sdlp ) purely to keep sf out of a seat ?
how can he change the mindset of hardline nationalist who see sf as traitor and refuse to vote at all ?
it seem that such a beautiful land have be create that it have to be balance out , so it be send the most evil of inhabitant to curse the land forever...
i think it 's a noble aspiration and , yes , unionist need to reach out to roman catholics .
there 's nothing ideologically unsound about that - after all , most roman catholics in scotland , england and wale be unionist , why should history prevent that from be the case in northern ireland ?
i 've not hear his full remark , just what i garner from the radio and a couple of short bit in article , but it really sound good and - whilst i still can n't bring myself to think of the dup as decent , mainstream and cross @-@ community - i think it 's a step in the right direction .
it surprise me .
do n't particularly give a ****.
never be to ni .
however , if the majority want to keep up a union with great britain then that 's fine .
what 's everyone 's opinion of it ?
do it bring out english pride ?
do it look like a piece of junk ?
tell me .
it really be n't very good look be it . even from a distance .
kinda look like a rollar coaster with some ugly grey tower go up the middle of it .
ahh well , good to know tax payer money be be well spent .
at least , i 'm guess the tax payer payed for this .
nasty tv guy ! yuc , i hate them
if he want it done , i do n't see what the problem be .
i dont think there be anything wronge with the except for the name of the program ; " mumifying alan "
he agree to do it .
what 's the problem ?
i do n't see why so many people be against grammar school , when really segregation happen anyway in comprehensive school .
the best abled pupil get put into the " top " set and usually get the best teacher in the subject department etc.
if that 's the case then why not just reintroduce grammar school instead of do this half hearted attempt at try to make it look like everything be equal ?
really , what be the point in the government make me eat lunch in the same room as violent yobo 's anyway and have to watch out for be attack in the hall way or firework snuck in ?
i feel like they be just try to piss me off , and i kind of am , at them and the socialist who push for this kind of crap .
are n't they phase out grammar school ?
there be one not far from me but it 's just a regular middle @/@ high school now .
where i 'm from 10 % of children will pass the 11+ and get into the grammar school .
the other 90 % be call failure at 11 and sent to an underfunded sink school .
why be it fair that 10 % of children get 90 % of the fund ?
grammar school also do n't allow for children to move up if they start work harder , it 's much easier to move from the bottom set to the top set within a school than it be to move from the comprehensive to the grammar school .
everyone deserve the chance for a good education not just the lucky 10 % who get into the grammar school based on one exam at the age of 11 .
how will libya 's oil reserve of 46+ billion be divvy up ?
if not the oil atleast a decent portion of libyas future outward fdi .
hopefully now we 'll avoid a double dip or prolong recession .
get that oil flow , dammit .
long live the the libyan interim national council ! !
if we want oil contract why would we bother with this ?
we should have just support gaddafi and he would have reward our support with more oil contract .
oh and just because there be reserve it do not mean they be financially viable , plus the tnc could just tell us to **** off like iraq do .
this be nothing more than a glorified bay of pig
the uk 's share of loot will be minumum , but bp will make a kill its investment be safe it have avoid a long drawn out civil war .
bae system have win
pan african solidarity movement have lose
i be in guatemala when the cia be prepare its attack on [president arbenz of guatemala , 1954].
his state have no revenue ; its biggest income maker be unite fruit company .
so arbenz put the tiny of tax on bananas...
we install a military dictator and there 's be nothing but bloodshed ever since." -- gore vidal
history repeat it self
i do n't really know what spoil be to be have , libya only produce 2 % of the world 's oil .
at least the end of the revolution @/@ civil war will make oil cheaper .
it 'll give political spoil to cameron and sarkozy , though , as long as the new government do n't cut off umpteen head in reprisal .
unless you mean something different , bp go back into profit only a few month after the gulf of mexico spill .
can someone explain the reason behind these riot to me ?
i 'm kinda slow , i have n't be follow the news for the past couple of day .
i log into tsr and am greet by load of thread about how it 's all kick off in london ( and a few scuffle in brum too ) but no explanation how they start then i go to the bbc site to try and get to the bottom of it but still no explanation !
basically , a guy get shot in london , police claim he be a gangbanger and shoot a police officer , local people claim he be innocent .
initial test reveal he do n't fire a bullet .
anyways , this kill lead to a riot in tottenham and people realised they could just break down shop window and take what they want , and burn car without be hold accountable .
so soon enough it spread to all over london... and now birmingham
so you 're say there be no reason ?
they just want a riot for riot 's sake ?
basically , a man call mark duggan be shoot to death on thursday reportedly by police , a bunch of people stage a peaceful protest and from that people have start use violence , loot and set building on fire , and it 's get worse because they 're realising that police can n't do anything about it .
the paper have it all wrong .
i live right in the middle of this crap , and i know of the sort of people who 're get involve , and it really just boil down to some entitled prick who 've realised that the police won't stop them from nick thing they want if they do it simultaneously , morality be damn .
that incident might have be the spark , but believe me on this , mate , there be no cause behind it anymore .
people be just take thing because they can .
most of the trouble around london be copy cat violence of what happen in tottenham where a 29 year old be shot by the police spark of a protest which gott out of control .
people see the loot go on and want some themselves therefore organising a riot .
so , anyone from gloucester ?
riot police , police dog and police helicopter confirm .
sound like the old college , the old woolworths and a car or 2 be on fire .
many other shop attack include argos , asda and a couple on king walk .
bad time
i work in argos and apparently it hasnt even be touch it be just the old college and barton street and woolworths .
ive hear that more be go on tonight though in the main town but we 'll just have to see , really pathetic though make me so angry .
really sad it 's hit gloucester but i 'm not that surprise .
hopefully these idiot will get bore soon enough and there will not be any more damage done !
london be burn and the media be not broadcast anything about it .
twitter be go mental with report of bomb threat , mass loot , fire etc.
this website be update every couple of minutes....
enfield , brixton , chingford , walthanstow , dalston.....all be looted...all be set on fire .
a massive morrisons in chingford have just be set alight ( from twitter ) ....this be mental !
edit : people be throw petrol bomb from bridge onto pass car on the a10 earlier....
have the police enforce a compulsory media blackout ? ??
the news be be purposely hide from the world ( to discourage further riot ? ) .
ive just emailed all the big news agency make them aware that we know they be hide this......
doubt i 'll get a reply , or anything will change on the news .
i think in the middle of all this carnage , everybody need to take a step back and just hug the internet .
the only omniscient thing i 'm aware that exist .
i be just watch sky news and the riot be all they be talk about for the past 10 @-@ 15 minute .
this be completely unjustifiable .
any sympathy the general public had for the man whose death supposedly spur on this onslaught of violence be surely be erode by the minute when thug be smash up the business , car and home of innocent people who have nothing to do with it .
was in brixton for the splash this afternoon , get violent at 5 o clock or so , very few police consider there be thousand of ppl , also hard to find first aiders why did n't the media report this early ! ?
they focus on shop be burnt late in the even but not violence at a family @-@ friendly festival etc
just wonder about the economic effect of these riots...
i do n't think that we 'll see any substantive impact in the city unless the riot do actually spread from the periphery to the docklands , or even the square mile itself which i consider very unlikely .
but this be go to his tourism badly .
it 's go to hit tourism really badly .
tourist be n't go to want to go to a city that 's unsafe where the police can allow mob rule in the street for three consecutive night , and understandably so .
this be the message leave our country to foreign investor : ' we , here in england , be mindless barbarian .
if you put your business here , it will not be treat with respect , it may be destroy , clearly we do n't have the money to buy your product '.
if i be a foreign investor right now , i 'd be look elsewhere .
it 's perhaps just the final nail in the coffin .
i 'm not his biggest critic by any mean , but this be the most out of touch thing cameron have say so far imo .
" the whole country want young people give the opportunity that work experience provide ."
what a mislead statement .
the country want unemployed people to have job , not be force to work for nothing .
you would have to be insanely right @-@ wing to describe anyone who think people should be pay for work as a trotskyite .
a lot of people on the right be oppose to the idea of what be effectively a tax @-@ payer fund subsidy to large business in the form of free labour .
my take it on this be that it 's a very poor solution to the catch @-@ 22 situation hit most young job @-@ seeker , but that it 's better than the future job fund and @/@ or do nothing .
it 's not force though , it be voluntary .
secret tip on how to avoid this ' slave labour ': when they ask if you want to do it , say no.
no it 's not .
it be if you say yes and quit before completion then you lose benefit for 2 week ( if an 8 week scheme ) .
one issue be that the actual scheme and the administration of the scheme be not match up .
the voluntary scheme itself be perfectly fine .
however , something have go wrong in the way the job centre have be portray it to some people , make it seem mandatory .
i know they think it be , and the prime minister be elect democratically .
but there be the house of lord and it pretty much feel like a country of ' lord ' and its like we be still stuck with some middle age tradition .
what do you think ?
yes , although i 'd like to see a change from first past the post to proportional representation .
also , to the op , i 'm pretty sure that there be hardly any hereditary peer leave in the house of lord
it absolutely be a democratic country .
we have an elect house of common which be sovereign .
people point to the inherit monarchy and the llife peerage as sign of not be democratic , but ignore one significant thing :
many other democratic country worldwide do not elect their head of state or their upper house .
for example : germany , italy , canada , australia , japan , holland , spain , belgium , sweden , norway , denmark , czech republic , hungary , greece and many others do not elect the head of state .
likewise , ireland , canada , germany , france , holland , jamaica and many others do not elect their upper house - at least not directly .
as long as the elect portion of the state ( i.e . the house of common ) have supreme power , then the democratic imperative be satisfy .
ironically , have other portion of the state elect will invite deadlock and compromise , and the democratic will of the people will be drown out in the politicking that will go on .
the lord increase democracy in the uk - it 's a safeguard .
firslty the chamber , although it have party politics , be keep in balance so it be not as partisan as the common .
secondly it be a chamber of expert which function in a largely advisory capacity .
thirdly these guy be lifer , which mean they be able to think past the next election for the good of the country .
i have far more faith in the lord as it stand than in the fptp house of common which lead to barrack by two party who be become increasingly differentiate only by the spell .
[reposting as a replacement for my last post which broke the rule by post a video only]
do you think it might have something to do with the fact that 70 % of the people of these island do not want this mass immigration yet our government allow million from very different culture to immigrate to these island .
we call anyone who say this racist . the u.n have define right for indigenous people .
we stand up for the right of the indigenous tibetans , native americans , maori and say that gandhi be a hero for stand up for the right of the indian people , but if someone want to champion the right of the british indigenous people they be either call racist , people want to have a riot against them and some people would send them to the gas chamber .
do you think the pressure of this suppression eventually give way to these racist rant which be become so commonplace that youtube be literally fill with dozen of them .
do you think it be just a co @-@ incidence that some foul mouth racist stand up and deliver some foul mouth speech or do you think that this be symptomatic of the fact that the british people have have enough of immigration and this be the start of revolt .
black people do n't work
therefore they can n't afford car
therefore they use the bus with the uneducated white chavs
( the first bit be a joke btw , im not a racist =[)
the right of the british white population do n't really need champion .
the only reason one would do so would be to legitimise ostracising people from other ethnic background .
that 's why champion right for white be view with suspicion , to my mind .
we do n't get .
i 've never see one .
where they happen they become viral video and even make the newspaper .
you might as sensibly ask " why do we get so many dog fall off trampoline at barbecue ? " or whatever it be that win this week 's 500 quid on you 've be frame .
the racist people that we have see on such footage be generally quite poor and therefore take public transport .
they evidently be quite angry that they do n't have much money and therfore take their anger out on other race and point the blame on them...
i 'd respect what she say if she do n't call me a "****ing foreign ****head ".
do n't agree with send her to jail though , what happen to free speech ?
i guess be unfair neutralises have a fare
it must be the new craze sweep the nation !
be there any evidence of a racist rant on an aeroplace yet ?
that 'd be the ice on the cake
because they be uninformed and support the bnp .
okay , not troll or anything but i have a question .
why ? i understand what both the bnp and edl want in term of aspiration and goal , ive studied policy and many response to them .
but from what i 've observe via tsr and many news source ; the way they 're try to achieve them , be largely violent edit : specific coverage of edl , whom seem to make the headline a little more .
aggression and hostility be obviously the worst way to go about to get these change make .
do n't they realise it ?
i 've see very little peaceful protest go on , which cause me to question the validity of both the bnp and edl .
and whether they 're genuinely think for the better of this country or they just house people who just want a fight , that have the option to jump on the bandwagon of uk politics . hence this thread .
i 'm not blame anyone , im largely try to remain neutral .
however , riot and fight take two to tango and there be obviously a massive contribution from the oppose party .
but , im just try to get a bigger picture here .
i 'd like for this to be a calm discussion and an informative thread .
for member and follower of both the edl and bnp to come and justify their point across so , not just i , but many others can be educate properly on the intention and the reason behind it all . regard .
first of all , i have no affiliation with the bnp , i find them ridiculous .
but how exactly be they violent ?
i mean , aside from the couple of mental member in the past , i have n't see much violence come from bnp member .
infact , overwhelmingly they seem to be the victim of violence and repression .
as for the edl . well , the thing be , they be never set up with specific political aim .
they be set up as an angry response to radical islam and islamisation , they be a street group , not a westminster lobby .
sadly , some of their demo 's have be mar by violence .
but an agressive opposition , along with a biased press and press with an agenda make them out to be a lot worse than they be .
that say , they be far from good .
the majority be loutish and do n't have any great intellectual capacity , but that do n't mean you should write them off , or that you should oppose their aim .
people who do n't think the bnp be violent do n't know **** about the history of the bnp .
yeah they wear suit now , but in the 80 s and early 90 s it be n't a political ' party ', it be just a street gang that use to fight with afa and commit random act of violence and vandalism against non @-@ white .
you can n't change that history by appear on question time .
and before anyone storm in with the negs and the ' that 's just slander where 's the evidence of this ', google be your friend , do your own research on the bnp vs afa and the link between the bnp and the nf , combat 18 , national socialist movement etc etc etc
with the scottish vote generally be a labour vote ( 41 of 59 seat ) would lose scotland give the conservative party a clear advantage ?
the conservative would lose one mp , be as labour would lose 41 mp 's .
although labour would of still win in 2001 without scotland , the conservative would of have a 21 seat majority in the last general election .
as well as this the forthcoming boundary change will see labour lose 28 seat compare to 7 for the conservative , not to mention union donation cap that would decrease party fund for labour .
with all the say , and with conservative likely to hold a natural majority if scotland gain independence , would that cause labour to push further to the right in order to try and steal the conservative vote and effectively leave behind the work class ?
personally i do n't think they 'd have much choice .
i be interested in hear people opinion on this .
unsure tbh , maybe would make the uk slightly more right wing but can n't imagen it become majorly right .
conservative win a majority of the vote ( but not a majority of the seat , hmm ) in england in 2005 and no doubt many more election where labour win in the uk .
wale be in between .
i wonder how ni would vote if the unionist choose between liblabcon rather then d/uup
what i find worry be that you think it be ok for a political party to change its core value and ideal , purely for the sake of gain power .
not because they believe in what they be say .
i 'm not say that it do n't happen already , but you seem to be imply that it be a totally understandable thing to do ?
unless i 've misunderstood what you be say ?
anyway , my personal opinion be that labour be n't truly leave wing and the conservative definitely be n't right wing .
they be as bad as each other .
as a ' right wing ' person (*cringe*), i sympathise more with some conservative policy but i do n't really like their leadership .
on the other hand , i detest labour with a passion .
good riddance if they loose their foothold in english politics .
steal the job traditionally do by teenager . absolutely disgust .
immigration do need to reflect surplus job available .
however , you get people like that girl sue the government for make her work in poundland not make thing better for anyone .
whilst in some case this be true half the time these people do the work the rest of the british refuse to do...
persay street cleaner as a prime example i cant remember the last time i see a brit do it yet people whine about the ' evil foreigner take our job '
if they wouldnt be so anally retentive in what they wish to do .
and on the broader issue thats what you get for join the eu you win some you loose some , simple .
basically with all this fuss about scottish independence in the news i 'm wonder how this bear for people who be n't 100 % ' pure blood scot ' for 7 generation or something .
i dunno why but it just boggle my brain .
if the snp get their way and crown salmond as king of his own private domain , who determine who be and be n't scottish ?
eu work and residency right no long apply follow independence , and i can see this potential event do nothing but fuel xenophobia , racism and nasty nationalism .
many english people have scottish relative or relative live in scotland long term , many scots move down to england , marry english people or have english relative .
who decide if they 're scottish or not ?
people who have live in scotland for decade could potentially find themselves alien in their own home , potentially consider foreign or ' not quite native '.
what about people who consider themselves british live in a british territory suddenly find themselves on the ' wrong ' side of the border ?
it seem absurd that they should suddenly consider scotland as somehow ' foreign '.
resident of other eu country would suddenly find themselves without eu protection either .
why be the snp so obsess with independence when there be no real political or economic mandate for it ?
surely it have to be for more than some infantile kneejerk obsession with the brave @-@ heart movie and a unjustified grievance with highly slant view on history ?
scotland gain nothing but get lump with stupid debt and political fallout , loss of influence and still economically and culturally tie to the rest of the uk as to make an international border seem utterly insane .
the scots themselves be an amalgamation of different people , picts , britons , gaels , norse and even anglo @-@ saxons .
it 's ironic that some scots take issue with the unite kingdom while ignore that scotland be create in much the same fashion .
so tsr , who decide what a scot in a ' free ' scotland be ?
someone that have a heritage that clearly show that the family have be in scotland for a long time they be scottish obviously although i be sure that someone born there would also be consider scottish as well ?
the only people who be not scottish would be those who move there à la not born there or have any previous family who be born in scotland .
as for who decide that could be tricky although i doubt it will be much of an issue .
i do n't see the situation be any different to the relationship between the uk and ireland .
it would n't really matter if someone be a scottish citizen or a uk citizen , because they will have equal right in both country .
right now irish citizen can freely live in the uk and can vote in general election and even run for office .
i 'm sure the same thing would happen with scotland .
it do still raise the question of exactly who can get scottish citizenship , but it won't really make any practical difference to people who do n't qualify for it .
scottish citizenship would probably be open to people live in scotland on the day it become independent , and anyone who have at least one grandparent who be born there , or something like that .
look at irish citizenship law , it would probably end up be quite similar .
its an interesting question .
i be born in scotland to parent who be born and raise in england , but then my mother side ( she 's an anderson ) have a long history of scottish ancestry .
i live there till i be four , but have live the rest of my life in england .
am i a scot ?
i imagine i will be able to apply for scottish citizenship , but will i be able to vote in a referendum ?
i doubt it .
in recent time and quite a bit more in the past it have always be heavily play on that uk prisoner be some if the most expensive people to keep in the uk .
so i be think , why be n't we make the people who have the ability to pay ( ie @- those people who have any sort of savings or credit ) to stay in prison ?
some prisoner be in prison with large amount of money in the bank so why be n't we take money back off of these people to cover the cost involve in keep them and court cost ?
if people commit the crime people should be willing to do the time and the people who can afford it , should pay for it surely ?
what be other people view ?
yeah man totally agree man they should register to a student loan alternative man and then like , sort of pay it off after their time in jail innit , i 'm gonna buy the domain prisonloans.co.uk now before anybody else smart steal it
the law should treat everyone equally - you can n't have some people pay and others not .
i agree with you that those that can should be able to pay .
however this also raise the issue that since they be pay money as well as serve their time in jail , their sentence should be reduce .
if this be to happen , would it not be unfair that other prisoner that do not have the mean to pay and have commit ' lesser ' crime have to serve longer than those that can ' buy ' their way out of jail , so to speak ?
take hiv as an example , the immigrant population have ten time the level of infection of the other 88 % of the uk .
the other disease be even more extremely biased .
what be your thought on this situation ?
personally i think it 's a very good thing , since our nhs should be work to treat all of the world 's sick people and the more diseased immigrant we have , the more good it can do for them .
also , have them live among us massively increase the risk of infection for the general population , make for a fair society .
why should we get to enjoy relatively low risk of serious infection when other part of the world be in great danger of them ?
test immigrant as a condition of entry to the uk would set us back decade and be morally wrong anyway .
their health status be none of our business .
yeah it be something that we should keep an eye on but what about people without medical record ?
what do we do with them quarantine them while we wait on test result ?
i 'm surprise that we do n't do this anyway .
surely , as a matter of common sense , if we get plenty of people from country where disease like hiv and tb be rife , it 's best to test for it and treat them upon arrival ?
both to prevent them spread it to the rest of the population and also for the welfare of the affect immigrant .
how be that an infringement on human rights...?
come to the uk be a choice .
we already impose condition on entry , why would one more be wrong ?
the problem be that you 'd have to pay to deport immigrant who fail the test when they refuse to leave of their own accord .
so , i 've be read about scottish independence and i do n't think it 's fair to solely concentrate on scottish independence and i 'd like to get the overall view of tsr member .
simple choice , either independence for your home country or to retain membership of the uk .
on the one hand , the union give us a bigger economy and population , and if it break up we 'd be less powerful .
on the other hand it 's a good way to get rid of 5 million labour voter and let the predominantly conservative england free itself of scotland 's socialist yoke .
so i 'm not really bother either way .
so i disagree with the whole tory ethos , and can n't stand what they 're do to this country out of sheer idealogy blahblahblah...
but the reason i really can n't stand cameron and his current cabinet be that they be constantly try to pull the wool over the public eye .
whether it 's by say all those in the public sector who will be strike on wednesday be selfish , or by osbourne selflessly wipe the vat on the x @-@ factor charity single , conveniently be name live on x factor infront on million of viewer .
they rip labour apart on the immigration issue in the general election , now look at the mess its in ! !
do anyone care ?
here 's a link explain the situation as some of you " righties " be oblivious to the situation .
food price @/@ petrol price be sky high .
when petrol cost rose when labour be in government , there be a media frenzy .
likewise when service have to shut down after a day because of snow , the media launch a full blown attack and everyday people be say how disgust it be .
when it snow under the tories and service shut for up to a week , noone care .
likewise noone be particularly fuss when osbourne blame the rubbish economy " growth " on the snow @/@ royal wed .
imagine the furore labour have say such a stupidly false thing .
sneaky nhs shake @-@ up .
if any of you have even use the nhs and have live @/@ travel abroad for a period of time , you will probably know how lucky we be to have such an amaze health service .
there be absolutely no need to open it up to private firm , and he swear blind in those televise debate that his party would n't touch our nhs .
what a crock .
youth unemployment the highest its ever be .
it 's be almost 17 month since the coalition have be in now , not 15 month as one of you say , or just 6 month as another one of you say
so blame labour for the world recession ( which by the way would have be even worse have the tories been in gov in the same year ) almost 17 month on where our economy have go backwards in term of economic growth from when labour left office , be ridiculous .
how many more year be you go to use it as an excuse for what be essentially a tory government dismantle the public sector while it can get away with it .
public sector worker be singled out to pay more into their pension funds...
my sister be a primary school teacher and teacher generally hate the tories , before all this pension business come to the surface but because they 're so backward when it come to education .
she have to pay out of her own wage for all her teach activites @/@ read books/teaching supply and only have a teach assistant twice a week now because they 've withdraw so much money from the school budget .
she 's a great teacher so buy all that stuff , whereas a lot of teacher might not bother as to be fair why should they have to spend hundred a year ? !
teach standard be go to fall massively over the next few year .
why won't the people of this country wake up and stop allow cameron to brainwash them ? ??
you need not to tell us why , as we already know .
we be like this because of financial issue out of our control and the mess of the last government .
if only cameron be do it out of ideology !
i would like a small public sector in this country .
government spend be actually increase .
you can hardly call the nhs shake up sneaky .
public sector pension will still be much better than private .
how dare we bring public sector pension more into line with the private sector ?
just who do we think we be ?
please , the average life span be ever increase , it 's put the contribution up , the pensio value down , or work long .
there be no other choice , the public sector have be spare this by 13 year of spineless labour government , but the fact be we cannot take this burden on at the expense of the tax payer any long .
most of those problem you just describe be the result of a flounder labour government who let spend go out of control and allow the nhs to disintegrate .
whilst i agree that d cameron and the tories be n't do everything they say they would , they be try to cut back the welfare state and dismantle some of the ridiculous law that stop business and worker from operate at their highest
also , petrol price be the result of numerous international economic factor and opec price control , the british government cannot control that .
op try to win brownie point from other clueless student who hate the conservative party just because .
and fail .
badly .
possibly because there 's no money to do anything anymore .
why ? because the wonderful labour party piss away trillion on try to create a client state .
absolutely there be problem in immigration .
this come the same week that report ( cost the taxpayer million ) be finally publish , have be commission by labour , but never release due to their finding which basically conclude that labour make the worst mistake imaginable on immigration .
food price be generally not the domain of the government , and the food price in the uk be relatively low compare to continental europe - certainly the eurozone .
been to cyprus recently ?
£4 for a packet of butter , anyone ?
fuel duty have be relatively slow to change since the general election .
when labour come to power in 1997 , you could buy petrol at the pump for 49.9p per litre .
when they leave , it be over £1.30 .
labour could n't do enough nhs reorganisation .
have you see what an nhs executive earn ?
how about a doctor or nurse that do n't actually have any patient ?
there be a lot of them work for health quangoes set up by labour .
very true .
there be a recession on , and the country be on it 's knee thank to rocket scientist g. brown .
damn right .
why should n't they ?
why should they be the only people to have gold @-@ plate pension with no detriment to anyone except the tax payer ?
what about private sector pension - they 're generally worthless .
why ? because they be rape by gordon brown .
at a stroke , by tax dividend he destroy private pension , cost countless trillion , but benefit the treasury a few billion which he whiz away on social engineer .
no one believe that . cameron be part of a coalition government , and face widespread opposition from the like of you , and hard @-@ liner in his own party .
i would suggest also that large number of people in britain be also resign to the fact that the country have its back break during the tenure of blair and brown .
except op explain exactly why they hate the tories...
nah i 'd go for sensible people with a realist outlook myself .
why would you call anybody " scum " for hold a moderate political view ?
do that post really constitute anything worth reply to , any well think and argue point ?
it be just the same politically illiterate ramblings you hear from any tory hate band wagoner , this should be leave for the column of heat magazine rather than a debate forum .
a study have find there be twice as many mix race people than report in the census .
around 2 % of british people be mix race .
couple with mass immigration , establish immigrant have children , and white flight .
the white british will all to soon dissapear , just another lost race in the page of a history book .
tony blair defend his immigration policy a couple of month back and i have to say i agree with him .
i 've always view immigration 's goal be to try change britain 's demographics and make it a fair society in the long run .
imo we have become a more mulitcultural nation , and and an ethnically richer diverse one at that which be necessary .
change the demographics be important for britain , it 's important for a lot of nation .
to those anti @-@ immigrant nationalist who hate this , look at obama , probably one of the most popular human being of all time , if not the most popular ever .
a lot of people like him for his charisma , his charm , his look , his speech even , i and many others also like him for his ethnicity ( sorry but i do it 's healthy for the world ) .
obama 's mix race background highlight humanities love for mix race people and our destiny to want to become mix race .
there be no doubt this be the way the world be go .
and obama as a figure head and his popularity prove that .
stun president .
so tony blair be right about immigration , and we be become more diverse thankfully , like america , because of it .
and maybe one day too we will have our own obama .
viva la difference .
thank you tony blair .
where tony blair and his government get it wrong be in underestimate the number who would migrate from the new country in the eu , and not then provide the resource to support this , for example in english language support in school .
for non @-@ eu migrant and those seek to live in the country , the support and resource to enable decision on their future to be make in a short period of time .
depends on if you believe blair do it for electoral reason or not .
immigration be good for a society , but open the floodgate like he do be quite frankly dangerous .
op spend a year in luton and tell us all of this .
besides , it 's funny how you talk about america like it 's improve lately .
it 's go down the toilet...........even more so by the day .
also , in reality , it 's not mix at all .
i promise you that obama be an anomaly .
most of america be about as mix race as roy chubby brown .
you mostly get concentrate ghetto with black people and then entire state full of white people .
obama be n't representative of anything .
as for blair , he only welcome all these new people because not him nor his mate have to live with them .
what do they care if you get new peckhams @/@ broadwater farm in other place ?
i think immigration level be high , and our past pm 's like gordon brown think that talk about high immigration be bigoted .
i have to say i disagree .
my father come from an immigrant background , and i dont think am bigoted for want to see lower immigration level .
i also think its stupid that our european friend can immigrate to britian and seek benefit , and deny them that would be against " human right "....according to the eu court of human right .
am i racist and bigoted for these view ?
no , say that immigration level be high be an observation and want lower immigration level be what many people want
everybody know the rate of immigration be too high but it 's not really what you say , just how you say it .
your belief do n't stem from believe your race be superior , or that immigrant or other race be inferior , but ' your racism ' be arguable in regard to prejudice , discrimination and antagonism ( also part of racism ) .
not say that you be , i be say that be open to question and have ground depending on how you go about these belief .
for example , if you make an unjust distinction of someone because they be an immigrant , not quite sure if that would make you a fully fledge racist , but it certainly would be discrimination .
basically there be a thin line .
suck but life be sometimes politically correct , but you have to learn to deal with it because you never know when you 're the one go to be on the other side of the spectrum .
ok , so i be still learn about how the free market/ global energy supply system work so please correct me if i be wrong , but here be my suggestion ;
all state service include social house , library , hospital , school , prison etc should be power by british energy only and everything the state use ( construction material , food etc ) should be british produce , grow and maintain by a british workforce .
alongside this , we open up the private sector to import and freedom of choice , luxury etc.
the private sector can do pretty much whatever it want but the state must be able to support itself with or without the boom and bust of the private sector .
people who choose to live on benefit ( rely on the state ) will only have access to british resource also .
( british grown ) food will be provide for survival as will house and energy but ( import ) luxury will not be available to those dependent on the state .
if people desire luxury , then they must work for it .
the idea be that the state pay ( modest ) salary for its worker who consume british energy ( retrieve this money through tax from british worker ) and british food/ material .
this would effectively create a system which circulate resource within the country rather than it be channel out into the hand of russian billionaires .
the energy will be supply through wind turbine position offshore around the british isle which be maintain by idle military personnel .
further , a production workforce will be employ by the state in factory to produce say material .
edit : why be everyone negging me ?
i 'm try to offer a solution to a problem .
and this will be pay for with what ?
so no library book from non @-@ british author ?
i think that demonstrate how quickly this idea be a fail .
also not too sure why you do n't think pensioner should be allow to buy themselves a bottle of champagne for their 80 th birthday party either .
that sound like an awful lot of government intervention .
your idea be crazy and would mean the death of the free market .
you have to let the free market work .
and then consider the burden on the tax payer....
the market should decide ,
if the people want british goods they will buy british goods .
if they want foreign goods they will buy those instead ,
it certainly be n't in the state interest to increase cost substantially by go exclusively for british goods of all kind ,
they should go for the cheapest best quality goods instead .
this be not a dictatorship .
you cannot force supplier to sell product for no profit
( they would simply move abroad where they can sell 100 % of their product at a profit ) .
thorium be a viable nuclear alternative and one which frankly we should already be adopt .
there be aspect of self reliance which would be good but on the whole protectionism be not a good long term policy to follow .
i 've really never understand this mentality .
here 's the crucial fact : we import more from other eu member state than we export to them .
any tariff they impose would hurt french , german , spanish and italian business more than it would hurt us .
the eu be fundamentally commit ( this be state in one of its treaty i believe ) to foster good relation and free trade with non @-@ member , especially those which maintain high standard of human right and democracy ( now ain't that ironic ) .
so if we leave the eu , we could negotiate free trade agreement individually with the union and its member ; we could join @/@ remain in the eec ; or we could join the efta ( eec @-@ lite ) .
we 'd have a range of option , all of which would keep our trade with europe strong and healthy .
will politician in germany and france want to stop brits from buy up their country ' bmws , mercs , audis , vws , peugeots , renaults , and so on ?
i very highly doubt it - not a vote @-@ winner .
as well as maintain our trade level , if we leave the eu we could save the several billion pound we donate to the eu each year , reduce immigration to more viable level , and shun some of the more overbear aspect of eu bureaucracy , all of which would benefit our economy substantially .
oh , and i forget to mention that it 's predict that the eu 's share of world trade and prosperity be go to massively decline over the come decade .
so why be everyone terrify of leave because of trade ?
the eu probably deflect as much trade as it create .
because we be part of the eu we trade more with member of the eu , such as germany , france , italy , spain , portugal , greece and ireland because we have a common market .
however what this mean be that we trade less with nation like china , brazil , india , japan and america .
i be not convince we want to attatch ourselves to the overly indebted nation of europe .
i would rather trade with the up and come emerge economy .
however as part of the eu you do get the appreciable benefit of free trade within the eu area .
however it be start to look like the member of the monetary union be go to try and exploit the common market member one eg . the tobin tax .
in the very long run i think be outside of europe and trade with the emerge economy , which will eventually become the big economy , be wise .
i agree with the europhiles that it 's important to trade and work together so the people of europe can collectively raise their standard of live , it 's just that the eu have prove to be a corrupt power hungry entity that have a socialist doctrine at it 's core so it 's not an ideal long term trade partner .
it 'd be like relying on the ussr to provide you with economic stability .
i need reason for why drug should not be legalised , any help please ?
i 'm for drug legalisation .
the government have absolutely no right to say what i can and can n't do with my body , as well as what i put in it .
we should be help those who use drug , not punish them .
you could make the point that by make drug legal and create potentially a bigger market for their use that food crop could be replace in develop country for drug crop much like the increase of demand for bio fuel have do , thus increase food price make impoverish people even poorer and increase inflation of food product which be bad for most consumer so drug actually have a massive impact on none drug user !
the problem with both of us be that neither of us specify which drug we be talk about .
some drug such as heroin be clearly awful - i certainly hope that you agree it be addictive and do harm others .
some drug have much less of a negative effect on the individual and other people around them .
cannabis be mentally addictive be still addiction .
the addiction may very well be weaker .
i agree , the government should help drug addict .
i believe that drug addict should be force to enrol on some sort of a program which be create to help them whether that would be in prison or otherwise .
( i also believe that smoke should be ban )
i think we 're all for legalize drug until you meet the poor guy @/@ gal who be n't from middle class @/@ higher class family and can n't afford rehab ( this come from a lower @-@ middle class guy ) who be sleep on the street in the winter in the snow before eventually die .
drug be n't good and be n't necessary , and ruin ton of people life .
i have use drug in the past and will probably do so sometime in the future , but it should n't be legalize .
everybody seem to forget about you know , the large amount of money spend in hospital treat drug user .
besides this , say the government should n't tell us what to do , well i hate every single politician , but use that arguement just make people sound like children .
perhaps reform , with more punishment on drug dealer would be good .
if you want to get philosophical , i will tell you what i believe to be the most detrimental effect of any recreational drug .
recreational drug cause euphoria .
hence , drug be an artificial substitute for a natural incentive that have evolve to motivate our species to do what necessary for it 's survival .
there be natural state in which human can experience these sensation .
we come with build in mechanism which produce these affect when appropriate .
this be ultimately why your body may produce some version of these chemical naturally .
these chemical reaction be usually trigger by behaviors which be positive in term of species propagation .
an example of such behaviors would be accomplish a task , or make a personal connection with another .
recreational drug be a waste because it be counter productive to nature , to society , and to your personal growth to have access to undeserved bliss .
if we be capable of produce a drug which induce intense euphoria , with no side effect , no adverse health risk , and be infinitely available , it would be catastrophic to our society .
it be easy for drug user to delude themselves into believe that the health risk be minimal when they be partying and have so much fun .
the biggest delusion of all be the one that most overlook .
we be not naturally meant to feel that good without achieve something to improve our existence .
i already know the kind of response i 'm go to get to this thread , almost by definition , because as far as i can tell you can split the english public into two group when it come to scottish independence ; a majority who do n't care above some vague notion that scotland probably cost them money , and a very vocal swivel eye unionist minority for whom scottish independence mark the begin of the end of their pseudo @-@ colonial ambition .
so i want to ask that crowd , and i already know they be go to be chomp at the bit to just click reply already , but i specifically want to know what it be you want out of the union ; i do n't want to hear about how scotland would be worse off somehow etc. etc. just why you want the uk to remain the uk and not split .
do it actually boil down to anything other than a perceive loss of prestige , the final nail in the coffin of britannia ?
i 'm english .
i think it would be nice if we stay unionised and strong .
but really , if scotland really want out , then let them **** off , because the whole point in such a union ( imo ) be that it 's voluntary and agreeable to all party .
scotland should remain as part of the union .
it serve nobody to break up one of the world 's oldest nation state .
all of the snp 's gripe can be solve by greater localisation - not by a pointless break up .
as for ' english people ' - the attitude generally seem to be one of ' let the scots decide , but i would be sad to see the unite kingdom dismantle .'
personally , i think it 's best to let the scots have their independence within 5 year , but before such plan be publish we should drill for all the oil they have and use it to pay off our debt .
after that if there be any remain debt they should be give around 1 @/@ 3 of it .
as i be write a post in another topic early about russia and their right to be a superpower , my mind ramble a bit and i start to wonder if great britain can ever become a political superpower on the international stage again .
90 year ago , the british empire be accountable for approximately 25 % of the entire world population , and britain have control of 25 % of the world landmass , therefore be able to completely dictate trade route and international relation .
a lot have change in 90 year , clearly .
in 2008 , great britian control very little in the way of overseas territory , and have a population of only 58,000,000 resident , many have move into the uk from other country .
we also seem to be lose the ability to defend ourselves politically , be subservient to the unite state in their quest to capture resource , and be a part of the european union , often have to accept group decision that the country do not agree with or benefit from in any way .
so , with all this in mind , can britain ever become a superpower again if desire ?
i know that we clearly will never compete with china in term of population , but be there any way to maximise the economic power of the nation in order to compete in term of financial position and ability to develop and expand faster and more sustainably than other nation ?
also , what would be the positive and negative for the general population if it ever be to happen ?
you could make a case for the uk be a financial superpower , we punch way above our weight politically and we have one of the best train militaries in the world .
yet superpower in the old sense of the word , basically be a colonial or military superpower , be something i think be out of our reach for very obvious and in my opinion desirable reason .
the best way the uk can stay on the world stage be do what it do now , be pretty much the top in the service industry .
the british empire be probably the greatest the world have ever know .
it be also one of the most brutal and morally abhorrent .
i think monopolistic power tend to corrupt and be almost invariably abuse .
anyway , we be a stable , wealthy country .
why do you care , ian ?
i hope this be n't some jingoist nonsense .
the fact be , it be n't go to happen .
yes it can .
whether it do become one remain to be see .
the next superpowers will be those who win the energy war .
that be those who develop the best and most efficient renewable @/@ readily accessible power source and be completely self sufficient on it .
possibly create a surplus .
in all honesty , i really see the eu be the next world super power in the next 70 year .
i mean we be get closer and closer to become a single ' state '.
i mean most of europe have the same currency , law and you do n't need a visa to travel between each country .
the numerous train operate company in britain make our rail system confuse .
they encourage high fare so that they can make profit , but do very little to invest in the network ultimatly leave britain with the highest rail fare in europe with one of the poorest service .
meanwhile , in other european country such as france and germany , the rail network be nationalised .
they benefit from low fare and quaility service compose of many ' high speed ' route .
privatisation in britain be suppose to encourage competition and therefore drive drown fare but i do n't see how competition on the railway work as each company usually have a monopoly on the route they serve
( eg . if you want to go from nottingham to london you can only use the east midland train )
so , do you think that we should re @-@ nationalise the railway and base the network on the french @-@ german model of low fare and high quality ? i certainly do !
we can n't afford it right now .
anyway if we have the money yes . not this idiotic subsidized monopoly
what happen to that company that walk away from one of it 's franchise a couple year back ?
i remember the government ( lord adonis i think ) say it be go to be punish , do anything ever happen ?
financially it may not be viable at present , but nationalisation ought to be a long term aim .
privatising the railway be arguably the worst thing the tories do .
in the meantime we need more regulation , especially with regard to fare , which be disgracefully high .
i support deregulation , and i be completely oppose to nationalisation .
in a time of economic downturn , you want to nationalise the rail network so the public sector ( who be already face with billion of pound worth of cut ) have to finance the entire network , include maintenance , investment and subsidy ? no thank !
deregulation or privatisation ftw.....or even just how it be right now....our rail network be n't that bad to be brutally honest ,
it get you from a to b , sure there might be a few delay before you get to c , but you 'll get there in the end
...and the tories be hop mad over it !
how long can cameron keep smooth the ruffled feather of his party ?
will this be the straw that break the coalition 's back ?
cleggy weggy claim a lot of thing .
it be n't really a lib dem victory , the general population be wholly against it from the begin .
nick should stick to weep to celine dion .
so we 've all be hear a lot about super @-@ injunction be litter all over the news , although one thing have struck me , that apply in almost all other european country apart from us : the defendant be always anonymous until proven guilty .
i think that until the defendant be prove to be guilty , they should be completely anonymous , to prevent false arrest get out into public and dent one 's reputation , as it be almost a form of defamation .
i do n't think it 's fair that case be so publicize , and should only be so open if the defendant do n't mind .
it be weird how people prove to be innocent be still hate because of the accuse crime , like the stigma of be call a paedophile even though it can literally happen to anyone and everyone .
would help if the media make a big thing about them be innocent , but most people be stupid generally , else this problem would not exist .
if you look at that joanna yeates case , everyone have decide that landlord be guilty up to the point where people hate him and the media be slaughter him .
turn out he be innocent .
not that the media owe him an apology or anything
fptp or av ?
supporter of each claim that the other will benefit " x @-@ treemists like da bnp ", but they can n't both be right .
can we find out here which vote system will benefit ( increase the power enjoy by ) small , " extreme " party like the bnp and green , with an explanation ?
do n't vote for av because you think it will help one party more than another .
vote for av because you think it will be more fair . if av result in more bnp mps , because more people in our country support the bnp , i think that 's fair enough .
we live in a democracy after all , people should be allow to vote for who they like and everyone 's vote should count .
honestly i hate these freak ' vote av and the tories won't get in ! ' argument , they 're so idiotic and not even true .
uk people @- who else here think we should use the single transferable vote as our electoral system ?
for those of you who do n't know what it be , i think stv be the main truly proportional system of elect mps .
candidate be number similar to av , but constituency be multi @-@ member so seat be allocate based on number of vote .
it 's the system use in eu election .
i 'm one of the few british tories who think we should use it , but what do you think ?
stv would be my ideal electoral system .
the whole constituency link issue would be less important if we have more localised politics .
i be sympathetic to stv , but then it seem that in the recent irish election it 's just as vulnerable to disproportionalities as fptp...
stv be far and above the most fair system in my opinion .
representative + constituency link maintain .
what more could you ask for !
invade libya .
think about it , what do britain have that there be a potentially lucrative demand for ?
the answer , a well train and heavily equip military , which although short on number at the moment , could easily be bolster in a very short period of time .
the libyan rebel be cry out for assistance in overthrow gadaffi , so i say we make them an offer .
we 'll send an army of 100,000 troop to take tripoli , and in return they will provide us with a promise of a fee - say , 30 % of all libyan oil revenue for the next 15 year .
so not only will the invasion create british job , take people off the street , provide invaluable battle @-@ field experience and be self @-@ financing....it could actually be profit make !
a 30 % stake of all libyan oil revenue over the next 15 year could be worth ten of billion of pound .
it 's just a shame that with clegg and the lib dems in a position of power , this left @-@ wing @/@ anti @-@ military coalition would never go for it .
bp and such british company be already in libya and have be for year .
drastic action like you suggest will just form a beacon for all extremeists in africa to come to libya to kill british citizen
100,000 troop there 's barely that many soldier and officer in the entire army , most of whom be not frontline but rather logistics , intelligence , engineer personnel and so forth .
you 'd have to start give sailor and aircrew rifle and combat gear .
we be do enough as it be in libya , anything further we can do must be humanitarian ( supply medical and food supply to misrata , for example ) or logistical ( supply train and weapon to the rebel in ajdabiya so they stop suck )
op i think you underestimate how long it would take to train and equip 100,000 soldier then all the logistics and other such thing that an army would need .
if you be go to do it well i 'd say at least 5 to 10 year .
especially if you be do it to the standard of the british army .
i 'm not insult politician here ; i 'm defend them for once .
i always feel that people be impossible to please when it come to how politician appear in public .
take the tv debate for example : everyone hate dave 's " down with the people " and " i meet a black man the other day..." act , but at the same time , have he remain aloof and fail to engage with anyone , he would have aggravate another group of people , and be call a toff even more .
another example be that recent departure lounge picture , which everyone decry as a fake .
again , it 's a lose lose situation : some say it be stage publicity , which be bad ; others say it be genuine , but the whole holiday be a pathetic attempt to pretend that " we 're all in it together "; others still would doubtless complain if dave flew off first class to a five star resort instead of use ryanair to go to some four star place in spain ( or wherever it be ) .
this be n't unique to the tories , those be just the example which sprang to mind .
sometimes i find satire a bit annoy , because it mean that politician can never seem to do anything right .
i wish people would keep the debate on policy and ability @/@ desire to deliver them , not who 's a toff or who 's fly which airline or holiday in which place , or use certain mannerism to respond to question .
just my random rant two cent .
yep , i feel extremely sympathetic to politicans .
i know quite a few personally and almost all of them be actually , dispite the hype , really good people !
they get hold to a higher standard than almost anyone else , seem loathe for do a very , very tough job and often for do what people claim they want them to do...
well , you know , i doubt whether some of these " hard work " politician would last very long if they have to work on a build site carry brick or steel gurders for 10 hour a day , or even work a 9 @-@ 5 carry heavy frozen meat produce from one cage to another 7 day a week .
i 'm sick and tired of this wishy washy social justice nonsense that the lib dems be inflicting on her majesty 's government .
what the country need be a tory government .
a proper tory government that will not be afraid to stand up for free market , hard work , britishness , israel and our military .
i hope to god the av referendum return a big fat no so that this horrid leave wing coalition can be return to the dust and we can finally get on with real , tory leadership ( thank to first past the post , of course ) .
what have first past the post get to do with have a tory government ?
the problem for the tories be n't the electoral system its that they do n't have enough widespread support in the electorate .
we have first past the post last time , the country be on its knee and we have have 13 year of labour government , with labour 's popularity at rock bottom .
but still the tories do n't have enough support to get a majority under fptp .
now the tories be face the unpopularity of government and labour be ahead on the opinion poll .
the lib dem vote will collapse but i bet more of their vote go to labour @/@ green than it do the tories .
i think the uk be a broadly tory nation up till the 1990 s but since then it have turn against them , they have their lowest ever day in the mid @-@ late 1990 s and early 2000 s , even since they 've have an upturn on the back of a labour government run into problem , they 've not be able to build a broad base of support in the country like macmillan or thatcher do .
the tories do n't get a majority because labour fix the boundries .
labour get a majority in 2005 with 9.6 million vote but the tories come short in 2010 despite have 1.1 million more vote than this .
some analyst reckon the tories need just another 15,000 vote to get that majority .
i would have vote based on what i think be best for the country .
if i honestly think labour could solve the problem , despite all my problem with them , i would have vote labour .
but that be n't the case .
but a lot of labour voter i know/ have meet , have tell me that they vote labour because ' tories only care about the rich '.
and that be it , you ask them why they think that and....nothing .
or another common reason ' tories will take away ema and give the moeny to the rich '.
well yes , they take away ema , but ema be a stupid system anyway , unfair and put in place by the labour government to try and make unemployment figure look better .
most labour voter i know in real life vote for them either out of ignorance and view inherit from their parents/peers .
or because they want their pocket directly line .
now , i know this be n't the case for all labour voter , hell there be some intelligent one on tsr , who vote for labour for decent reason , and though i disagree i respect them for that .
i just feel that labour get a lot of vote from the reverse @-@ snob work class in area like mine .
so they can quite literally do anything , and people will still vote for them over the tories .
i 'm fairly right wing , but i do n't think a full on tory government be what anyone want .
this be a centrist country and the government should reflect that .
i 'd like it if we elect very socially liberal government all the time ( to the point of legalising and tax all narcotic ) , but i know that won't happen .
i 'd like withdrawl from the eu , but that won't happen .
politics in most democratic country do usually hover around the centre .
apart from the us , but that 's a cultural thing really .
as a labour party supporter , i disagree with the cut that the coalition government be currently make .
they be go too far , too fast .
their policy of contractionary fiscal policy create a substantial risk of the uk slip back into recession , which mean consumer confidence will begin to fall even further , as people will be more likely to save , which lead to less money be pump into the economy , ie . a fall in aggregate demand .
with current level of unemployment very high , job loss will be the consequence of these harsh , unnecessary cut through the coalition government 's contractionary fiscal policy .
on the other hand , labour 's policy of expansionary fiscal policy mean that although the budget deficit will increase , a significant number of job will be create , aggregate demand will increase , which mean an increase in consumer confidence , therefore household income will increase , which may result in taxpayers move into a higher tax band , which lead to an increase in government revenue from taxation .
if we carry on with the current rate of cut , we will reverse to the 1980 's , make the poorest poor , and the rich rich , same old tories !
cut need to be make at a steady pace , with the budget deficit dealt with once the economy be full steam ahead .
all view , opinion and thought be more than welcome
definately pro @-@ cut , even though the wife lose her job , she still agree with the cut , it 's for the good of the country as a whole
pro cut for me to because if you invest in the public sector like labour would it mean your get growth based on debt which doesnt work then we 'll eventually have the same problem again and run out of other people money to spend .
the only way you can have growth be by private investment .
i 'm not against the cut per se .
i 'm just against the reform that be go to cost as much to implement as they save and be do for ideological rather than financial reason .
cut be more or less inevitable , even if i do n't necessarily agree with what , when , where , how and why .
it make me cringe that the government be cut fund for the british people , and yet somehow fund the military to rain cluster of bomb over foreign people !
to be honest as much as everyone dislike them i do n't see any other political party put forward a decent proposal
this country literally have no money and be in huge amount of debt
i 'm against the increase in uni fee though , on the whole i do realise that university fee do have to increase , but treble them within the space of a year be far too much
i apologise in advance if there be something similar to this thread , but this be a topic that have interest me recently and would just like to hear your view on the matter .
i 'm a british pakistani , born and bring up in london , however i would say i be very much in touch with my root and my view lean more towards the traditional and conservative side .
recently i watch a documentary by saira khan ' don't tell my mother i be in pakistan ', make a few year ago , yet a very interesting watch .
i have be on holiday to pakistan a fair amount of time , and have traveled throughout the country , so i think i have a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it 's people .
however , after watch the documentary and various other programs and film on pakistan i be absolutely shock .
i may be wrong when i say this , but be pakistan not found as a muslim state , yet only 64 year on and i do n't think the country match the vision it be initially create with .
it seem that the higher class be obsess with imitate and adopt western culture , in a sense it boost their superiority complex .
i actually find it shock , that most family who move to england in the 60 's like my grandfather have manage to maintain that cultural pride and certain tradition that have be lose among certain group of people in pakistan .
drink be a common practice with the upper class society and personally i find it quite upset , it seem as if pakistan be move in the opposite direction @- the rich become more obsess with western culture and the less well off be neglect further .
also whilst i 'm on this topic , have anyone see the film ' slackistan ' and what be your view ?
thank for read my thought !
liberalization be move in the opposite direction ?
personally , any nation 's judiciary system that be in anyway influence by objective morality scripture and superstition have no place in the 21 st century .
while i can understand your sentiment that be undesirable for tradition to be dismantle , ever since the fall of the wall in 1989 , liberal democratic value have spread ( end of history , fukuyama , 1992 ) and that do not preclude ( just yet ) the sovereign state whom be conform to islamic teaching as their rule of law .
western culture give people individuality and let them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberty they desire ( as long as it do n't harm anybody else ) .
i think it be the right direction that western culture ( unforced ) be spread , it give a common ground for different culture to interact , promote tolerance and allow people to pick their own way of life .
i do n't see that be a problem .
and that 's a bad thing why ?
westernisation = progress .
imitate the most developed country in the world be n't really a bad thing .
pakistan be found on the basis that muslims feel their interest would not be guard by a hindu government , not as some spiritual muslim homeland .
as it be , i 'd hardly say pakistan be ' western ', what with it 's blasphemy law , it 's constant conflict with india , conservative populace , tacit fund and support for various islamist organisations .
i think rather than worry about the populace , worry about yourself .
who be you to judge people if they wish to drink alcohol , or watch western tv ?
also , as you bemoan the west . it 's worth remember you would n't have have a country without us
i simply do n't get why iran be such a huge threat .
they be merely retaliate to whatever our politician throw at them !
" if iran change course , abandon its nuclear weapon ambition , and life up to its international obligation , it will be welcome back into the community of nations."...
as a weak country with no big weapon to defend its people..
yeh right , they 're so on board with that !
all the huge country that be bully iran into submission right now with sanction and what not have nuclear weapon ?
how on earth be this fair ?
all the sanction be affect ordinary iranians !
soar food prices/ fuel...
why be the world do nothing ? !
do we want iran to become the next north korea ?
this be totally unacceptable !
not to mention the meddle we have be do inside iran for the past 100 year or so... install the shah.. overthrow democratic governments...
hey israel , how about you assassinate some more iranian scientist ?
absolutely degrade behaviour by the west , no wonder they hate us !
because they have a pretty crazy guy at the head of their goverment - who 's develop nuclear weapon .
not to mention the grudge they have against the west .
they have a bad history of blow thing @/@ people they dont like up...
negs , quaint... be you all dispute irans know history of terrorism or be you all moron ?
because mahmoud ahmadinejad be a maniac .
what kind of history do the us have then ?
dont remember iran start a war the last..lets say 2500 year ?
that be a tongue in cheek remark i wasnt be entirely serious .
largely rhetoric to lie the groundwork to get support for the war .
this be n't do properly before go to war in iraq and we have people oppose to it from the start , also go in with mix message ' its about wmd and a bit about regime change ' look bad when there be n't any wmd there .
so we need to go in from the start say with iran it 's about regime change , ahmedinijad be bad , he do n't respect womens right or whatever otherwise you will have the same situation if we say its about nuclear weapon and then go to war and do n't find any nuclear weapon .
i can understand the argument that nuclear proliferation be bad and any of these state have nuclear weapon be not desirable as it just lead to proliferation in the region , but that argument should have be use against pakistan and israel get nukes .
people say iran have nukes be a risk because terrorist might be able to get hold of nuclear material...
well hello...pakistan have them .
remember when we go in to take out bin laden we could n't tell the pakistani government for fear that bin laden would have be tip off and escaped...
that hardly fill me with confidence that they should be allow to have nuclear weapon .
the problem with these ' resolution ' targeting iran be that everyone can see the hypocrisy , its a case of our ally can have nukes but others can n't .
a much better resolution would have be a hard resolution on non proliferation and disarmament in the region , which mean india and pakistan have to disarm and israel have to disarm , and any move by any country in the region towards get nuclear weapon would be meet by international air strike .
i could definitely support that as a non proliferation treaty .
i 've heard story of pakistanis , indians , bengalis , filipinos , iranians and arabs with african root be racially abuse in place like saudi arabia , uae , bahrain and so on...
are you a non @-@ arab minority live in the middle @-@ east , or do you know someone who do ?
do you feel that the problem of racism be a big or a small one in comparison to place like america ( the southern state in particular )?
it 's not so much racist , as it be ' classist '.
people from india , pakistan , and so on often work as maid , driver , etc. in the middle east .
they do n't abuse you because you 're a certain skin color , they abuse you because they think you 're some servant that barely make any money and should be grateful for be there .
yes , there be racism in some arab country in the middle east .
if you be from pakistan , india , bangladesh or any country that be n't very rich then you be mostly treat like crap .
however , if you be british , or from the us or any other rich european country then they treat you really well .
indians in particular be treat badly , there be indian maid and they be often hit by the house wife if they for example make a small mistake or sometimes they be hit with no reason .
i have relative who live in one of those rich middle eastern country and as far as i know they tell me that some of them whilst at school have experience racisms from children for example one of them a girl be call black and ugly and that her hair be bad but the teacher do n't do anything about it , they be racist themselves .
i have to admit i be really quite worry about russia..
in the mainstream media and popular consciousness the big doomsday scenario mainly centre around iran and china , obviously both of those be grossly misrepresent , the idea of a us @-@ chinese war for example be objectively absurd and no serious commentator pay it any attention , it 's really just a propaganda tool and an exciting subject for video game .
the situation in iran have the ability to cause a lot of misery in the middle east but again , iranian leader be really quite self aware , they know what they be do , and there be near enough no risk to the world at large even if they do acquire nuclear weapon of them actually use them , although we as simple peasant obviously need to believe that and go along with our government because if iran do become a nuclear power then it will have a lot more independence and influence in the region and that obviously can n't be tolerate .
anyway , russia , it seem to me , be the real potential doomsday scenario here .
almost all the condition of wiemar germany be present ; economic downturn , unemployment , a recent history of loss of empire , rise nationalism and xenophobia .
and just like germany there be a hard turn to the far right by the country 's middle class and the rise of egomaniacal leader who be already undermine what little democracy there have be in russia .
there be even putin youth league harass opponent above the law .
you have the ultra nationalist and deeply racist cossack tribe , highly militant , extremely aggressive and become more and more mobilised , convince that the time have come for mother russia and that x , y and z ethnic/religion/political group be responsible for the loss of russia 's glory and therefore must be eliminate .
just like germany be , russia still be a major military power , a nuclear one , and with enormous economic potential .
honestly when you think about it it really do look just.. terrify .
am i miss something here ?
can anyone explain further or recommend some read ?
yes , russia do have huge problem with neo @-@ nazi ideology ( which be kind of ironic give the history of russia ) .
it 's military be pretty brutal as well - see chechnya .
russia regularly interfere in it 's neighbour ( such as the ukraine and the invasion of georgia when it become too western ) , but i do n't think it have much power beyond that , that be n't to say that they would n't if they could .
but they be hem in by china , europe and the unite state .
there be a lot of bitterness about how ex @-@ ussr state have become part of ' the west ' ( like poland and estonia for example ) .
what specifically be you concern about ?
it be n't go to invade europe again if that 's what you be concern about .
i mean they help the invasion of afghanistan and putin ask to join nato .
their close " western " ally be france and italy ( and they be close ) .
russia be n't really that close to any major power .
i disagree with this , at least not without huge structural change .
it have terrible future demographics ( with no available fix through immigration ) and be totally dependent on export oil and gas - as well as be run by corrupt oligarch ( who make western corporatism look non @-@ corrupt and benevolent ) .
i think russia be pretty neutral about most international affair now , so i do n't see the big worry .
russia have be reduce to nothing but a peripheral country that condemn whatever resolution the west put forward .
the russian government be pretty bad , but their opposition be worse .
the leader of the second largest party in russia , the communist party , want russia to be " re @-@ stalinised ".
the third largest party , the liberal democrat , be pretty nutty too .
first off , a disclaimer of sort , these be my opinion based on news report and a little research around the topic so i apologise if my fact be wrong or inaccurate .
like the title say i welcome thought either on my opinion , or on the matter in question .
anyone who follow the news will have hear in amidst all the " eu crisis " there be an issue grow between the west and the middle east .
specifically iran and its attempt at a nuclear program , where iran hope to gain nuclear power for peaceful purpose ( iran 's statement ) .
the us and eu however believe that iran be use this nuclear program to develop and obtain nuclear weapon claim they have " information suggest iran have carry out test relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device ".
due to this the us and eu have impose sanction on iran involve limit on the oil buy from iran which in turn decrease their economy and other sanction of similar consequence .
right now that that 's do i can state my opinion , please correct anything i have put that be wrong !
my opinion in short be this , the us and eu have no right to impose sanction on iran and to deter their nuclear program .
however , i be very oppose to iran gain nuclear weapon and threaten ww3 and in fact i be oppose to any country have nuclear weapon .
the only argument the us and eu have be that iran be not a stable country at the moment and a unstable country should n't be able to kill million at the touch of a button .
however for them to tell another country what they can n't have , when they have nuclear weapon themselves be nothing except hypocrisy .
from iran 's point of view , one could argue that our government be unstable with new leader every 4 year with differ opinion and view .
what right do we have to dictate what another country can and cannot do .
i think that 's the essence of my argument , and i accept that the " iran instability " be a big part of the sanction .
thank you for read and i hope i 'm not completely ignorant here !
why do country not have a right to tell others what to do ?
people tell each other what to do all day every day , why should country be exempt ?
of course , iran have every right to say " no ", but then those other country have every right to refuse to trade with them .
though i do n't believe we should have nuclear weapon either - it 's not hypocritical as such .
have a new leader every 4 year do n't make a country unstable ( otherwise irans single leader would be highly stable ) .
most country who have nuclear weapon now can be trust not to abuse them - iran cannot .
regardless , i personally do n't think world security should be hold back just because someone be worry about be a bit hypocritical .
i believe that the only reason why american gun sight have be train on iran be because of their decision to switch from petro @-@ dollar ( american ) to the gold standard or something similar .
this would would have a detrimental effect on the american economy , or practically any economy that relies on the dollar as a currency and as a result , the already weak american economy would lose it 's lead place .
all the other aspect , nuclear power and oppressive regime be just a side issue .
this be demonstrate time and time again when saddam switch to euros in 2000 and gaddafi want to switch to the gold standard before he be topple .
the eu also want something similar and i do n't know what happen to that .
there be still no evidence against iran .
the iaea have be in many time .
all we have be suspicion .
also the iaea publish the name of all iraqi nuclear scientist be rather sinister .
they very well knew this be like gold dust to israel and america ie assassination target . impartiality ?
i think not .
the hypocrisy argument get nowhere , but most fail to understand the double standard suggest an ulterior motive , at the least a lack in credibility of the west .
israel have illegally obtain and continue to have a nuclear arsenal , not to mention the innumerable un violation against it 's neighbour , yet it be metaphorically scot free to do as it please .
it 's like they be play poker : the political leadership of israel / us and iran seem to me more likely to " go all in " rather than back down and fold or negotiate .
i think it 's a while off yet .
iran be have a decent time trade with the east , and try to stick two finger up to the west .
neither side want 's to jepordise their economic security by engage in what will be a costly and deadly military action .
i think the only problem will come if and when iran stop allow nuclear inspection , or when the un/nato/the west decide that there be a high probability that iran be near realisation of weaponised nulcear material .
i personally find russia 's behaviour at the un this week to be absolutely disgust .
apparently they 're threaten to veto a resolution on syria if it do not explicitly rule out foreign military intervention .
the text have already be ' water down ' to omit the demand that assad step down , yet again to appease the kremlin .
every day nearly 100 innocent civilian be be massacre by the fascist government in syria ( at a far quick rate than those palestinians who have die at the hand of israel ) .
but where be the demonstration ?
where be the ' blood for oil ' and ' victory to the intifada ' moron ?
where be the hysterical student compare medvedev to hitler and assad to an ss commandant ?
where be the russian flag be display next to swastika ?
where be michael moore 's film condemn these indiscriminate murder ?
where 's the public outcry about russian veto and unilateralism ( a criticism routinely employ - rightly - against the unite state when it veto resolution on israeli aggression )?
so many have be kill that the un have give up try to count casualty , and yet we have a clique of barbarian and mafia crook in moscow hold the world hostage over this issue .
russia be renovate a military base in syria , have arm deal worth billion , infrastructure and energy deal .
russian oil , gas and steel company have substantial interest in syria include an arab gas pipeline , gas process plant , deal with national syrian oil company and oil exploration there .
russia want stability and a friendly regime to ensure the security of their interest , so they back assad .
that 's russia for you .
nevertheless , assad would be lucky if he survive this year .
it 's a similar situation to libya .
the rebel need help with the big military target , but when it come to grind operation , they be more than capable of handle the situation .
if you wish to understand russia 's reason , know its national interest .
in this case arm contract worth $ 4 billion be a national interest .
no way be they go to let that go down the drain if they can do something about it .
nor be they will to lose face by openly support the syrian regime .
they will just exercise their un privilege and keep sneak the promised weapon into syria one way or the other and keep cash in on the opportunity .
personally , i do n't think they would start ww3 if iran be attack , because they have more to lose , and they 'd probably just do thing like supply weapon etc...
any one else have an opinion on this ?
if ww3 do break out , we know we can go to greenland or egypt
good to see china back the iranians .
whilst i think the prospect of ww3 be a slight bit of over kill the chinese do have a point in that the west be in no position to meddle in iranian affair least of all at this stage
china hey dude , sup
iran hows it goin bro
china yeh just u no how u like killin your own peep just like i do ?
iran yeh lol
china let like hang out together n attack ppl who try to stop us killin our peep
iran sure thing bro
china would eventually lose .
anyone , watch any of the gop republican presidential debate , as you can see the media pathetic effort for pretend that ron paul do n't exist .
ron paul be right on every level but the mainstream media do not want him to get as much talk time as other puppet such as rick santo rum and mitt romney
i 'm in .
he be amaze , the only person who can take the usa forward .
however , he appear to be lose steam as a result of the time of florida and s. carolina .
do you realise that ron paul would disapprove of the video in your sig vehemently ?
probably , but then due to the fact it 's get more space , the usa do n't have the same problem with muslims as europe do .
also , the usa 's biggest problem at the moment be an economic one .
people be say this everywhere now and the consequence be unknow .
could this really happen ?
only if ron paul doesnt become president then there will be war .
the u.s. have n't the capacity to commit to a full @-@ scale war with iran at present if one keep in mind its quite significant pre @-@ exist commitment , the state of the economy , and the strength of iran 's defensive capability - targeted strike( s ) seem more likely , or perhaps greater action by israel , but i doubt that .
why be the unite kingdom allow asma assad and her three children to remain in the uk ?
i know she be born and raise in london , but do you think that the uk be as anti @-@ assad as it claim ?
one word , three letter , two vowel , one consonant .
oil
but there be sanction on oil export ?
i know this sound too nice but it 's maybe because a person family should not suffer for the ' crime ' of an individual .
she 's british i think .
we 've be hear a lot in the news about iran and its threat to shut the straight of hormuz , and how western country ( e.g . the uk , the usa and france ) , but how be the country around the straight react to the threat ?
as i cant seem to find anything on how country such as oman , iraq the uae be react .
wild speculation be welcome here
this be backwards .
it 's not a threat , it 's a response to the threat of others , e.g " attack us and we 'll close the strait of hormuz ".
there be nothing for other country to respond to .
they be the would @-@ be aggressor .
unfortunately most tsr'rs be too brainwash to see that .
just so stupid .
iran 's the only one with the ball to stand up to israel/usa .
if they fall due to the surround country go against them , then they 'll continue remain sheeps and it won't be long till they 're topple themselves .
i support saudi 's arm up though , as i do for all muslim nation , weapon may be useful in future .
the islamic republic only exist in part because of israel .
israel sell almost one billion $ of arm to the islamic republic during the iran @-@ iraq war and provide load of military aid ( this be while israel be apparently a suppose sworn enemy ) , train and even helpfully remove iraq 's nuclear capacity in operation opera ; where if saddam have develop nuclear weaponry he would have undoubtedly use against iran .
did you know that there be a camp just outside tehran of israeli tactician aid khomeini and co against iraq for the whole of the conflict with iraq ?
the islamic republic owe an awful lot to israel - it enable it to survive against saddam and continue the war with iraq ( by continue the war this enabled it to solidify it 's position by kill thousand and thousand of iranian democrat and other member of the opposition - as well as terrorising the population ) .
do n't forget that iran support america when they invade afghanistan and iraq as well .
these be the fact :
in the west , it be threaten by iraq , in which us force be still present
in the east , afghanistan have at least 100,000 us troop alone
south @-@ east , pakistan which have nuclear arm , corrupt official and be a us ally
all around be arab country with friendly tie to the us who keep rally for the ' head to be cut off the snake '
north @-@ west , turkey , nato ally
north @-@ east contain refuel station for us millitary vehicle in turkmenistan
who be really be threaten here ?
sorry to inform you : that be exactly why we would go to war :p
as nice as it would be for country like the usa and the uk to be over there to help , the truth be we would n't interfere if it be n't for the oil and other economic and political gain .
if they do restrict the straight it will will cause a massive decrease in the amount of oil to the west ( 40 % of import oil come from the straight accord to a figure i see on the news ) , and our economy would greatly suffer...
we would in that situation definitely cause a big commotion .
i highly doubt there would be a ww3 , but i do know for certain that the big country and supper power would go to war due to globalisation and economic link .
in australia the poor quality of local broadcaster 's international news seem to have completely baffle the general population as to exactly what be go on , the coverage be utterly appeal to be honest and regularly confuse their nuclear programs and their attempt to blockade the strait of homuz .
politically the general gist of thing be that the current labor government be stuck between suck up to the unite state and therefore get embroil in any potential conflict ( hmas parramatta be presently off somalia under nato command and could get draft in should military action commence ) and the fact that the green now have control over them through their control of the senate and their single lower house seat ( hung parliament for you ) and of course be very anti @-@ war , anti @-@ nato and anti @-@ anzus .
the ultimate result will be down to who be prime minister when such a situation occur , accord to the union they intend to fire gillard next month and replace her with kevin rudd yet again who be extremely pro @-@ china and less align with the unite state although he will probably suck up to obama as well .
the opposition will attempt to counter any potential for enter the war with statement such as " they 'll be iranian boatpeople " cause national panic and further hatred of innocent refugee potentially lead to an early election and a coalition ( liberal @-@ national ) government be form who will support the war to a degree but otherwise will be to focused on nauru which be the main aim of their entire foreign policy .
over these past two year , i have notice an increase amount of anti @-@ iranian news report which have culminated in the recent attack on the british embassy with both country expel our respective diplomat .
it now seem certain to me that within the next decade the u.k and u.s.a among others will be involve in a fully fledge war against iran .
throughout history , the expel of diplomat have usually meant one thing and when this be couple with the arab spring alongside general unrest for a long period in iran , it seem inevitable we be head towards another war .
as a general question , i would like to ask others to see what you think ?
are we go to war , what can we do to avoid this and just in general for people to air their opinion on another war in the middle east .
p.s. just to clarify i be neither anti nor pro war , this be just a launch pad for a discussion .
given the israeli mentality i would say we will see them strike iran .
would't be shock if they use nukes either tbh
that be a big claim ,
it would quite an amaze escalation if israel use nuclear bomb on iran .
i know , however israel be go to know that if they strike iran iran will hit back .
conventional weapon may not even be able to hit some of the fortified facility either .
the idea of a single debilitate strike on iran that will stop it ever be able to strike back be go to be very very tempt for israel .
and depending on which way the american election go american support may not be forthcoming if someone like ron paul get elect
if they have @/@ get nukes , no one 's invade iran .
i personally think it would be cool , israel might have to think twice before carry out major bombings in palastine etc.
there will always be that deterrant if iran get nukes .
of course not but the question be fast become not will israel strike but when and how .
a conventional strike on iran be go to raise massive geopolitical consequence too . include huge damage to the world economy and the possible destruction of israel .
bit of a novice at economics but i be wonder , after kim jong @-@ il 's death why be the stock market in asia @/@ korea fall ;
be they anticipate something ? thank
this will hopefully herald the end of socialism as we know it as people will realise that it be doom to fail .
just lead to insecurity in market
you look at koreas neighbour china , south korea etc all major player in the world economy .
im sure some dirty banker have vest interest also .
but whose to say it be kim jong bring down the market .
with the primary quickly approach i think it would be a good idea to have a thread on everything relate to the 2012 election .
who do people think will be the republican nominee ?
who do you think have the best chance of beat obama ?
for me it seem that it be go to come down to a two @-@ way race for the nomination between romney and gingrich .
i can n't see any of the others get the nomination .
romney probably have a better chance than gingrich of beat obama .
there be now a poll .
if you do n't think any of the candidate can beat obama then that go under ' other '.
i personally would like to see ron paul be the nominee , but backmouth probably have better chance of become a tsr mod than this happen .
the republican will probably go with romney over newt gingrich .
it be a shame that scandal have hit herman cain because he have promise .
i be an independent voter and my opinion be that who ever the republican nominee be , they probably won't be willing to do what 's necessary for the u.s. economy if elect .
if obama be reelected he definitely won't be willing to do what 's necessary for the economy .
i hope most other independent feel the same .
i 'd be happy with anyone but obama who want nothing less than our economy 's complete demise and be clearly anti @-@ israel .
what do everybody think about the possibility of go to war with iran ?
the us be make move encourage a very likely chance of war !
do you think it will happen ?
do you think it should happen ? discuss...
mark my word . no other country will attack iran except for israel , with perhaps military support in term of intelligence from the us/uk .
the uk do not have the mean to carry out an attack on iran . -
forget the fact that the us/uk/nato would never get the support from the international community to carry out an attack .
israel ? they can do what they want .
what be people view on the current british occupation of ireland .
should it be free from their imperialist grip etc....?
what do you 's think of the current arm struggle ?
was the war involve the ira and inla a success or a failure ?
and what be your view on those try to establish a socialist republic in ireland ( not the guerilla army 's )?
i really do n't think anyone in britain care much about ireland .
i do n't think many people really understand why you insist on murder each other either .
ireland need to overcome its grip of alcohol .
first , britain no long occupy the southen 26 state .
the idea of an arm struggle be preposterous , even to strong nationalist the idea of free healthcare , a stronger economy and less corrupt politics make war even more ridiculous .
currently those in the ira be terrorist fight a pointless war they 'll never win .
socialism be in itself a fair theory for government , yet no country have establish a socialist republic that be superior to the current democracy
the law of return give jewish people and those who half jewish on their mother 's side the right to become israeli citizen .
this be a ridiculous sexist and racist law that nation around the world should oppose .
britain be now refuse to give aid to country who discriminate against gay , we must now do the same to sexist and racist nation .
a number of state world wide have similar discrimination , however we deem israel as a modernised civilize society .
israel must set an example to these less develop nation by scrape this outrageous policy .
what if the government say all people of european heritage be free to become british citizen would we call them racist ?
israel be a jewish state , specifically .
create for the jewish people , do n't seem that odd that if you 're jewish you 're allow citizenship .
judaism be pass through the mother ( a jewish mother make you a full blood jew , not half jewish ) that 's how judaims work .
so it 's not that sexist per se it simply follow the jewish law of inheritance .
other religion be pass soley through the father , be they sexist too ?
make aaliyah be n't exactly a small step...
and as soon as you 're a citizen if you 're under 40 ( 35 for women ) you will have to join the idf .
i just do n't think it 's that shock or appal .
also , they have a very good refugee policy - they 'll take pretty much anyone who be flee for safety .
country be free to make up immigration rule as they please .
it happen here in the u.k and around the world .
for example if my grandfather be a british citizen born in the u.k , who then move and marry a none british citizen , and they then have my mother outside of the u.k , my mother would still be eligible for citizenship .
however if my mother then marry a non brit and give birth to me outside of u.k i would no longer be eligible for citizenship as citizenship right only extend one generation in the uk .
however if it be ireland instead of the u.k i would still be eligible for citizenship if my grandfather be irish .
so i would be irish if my grandfather be irish , but i would not be british if my grandfather be british .
be this discriminatory ? yes..
but immigration law by their very nature be discriminatory , that be their whole purpose , to discriminate who be and who be n't allow into a country .
all nation have them and they all tend to be different ( which be normal consider different nation have different culture , tradition and custom ) , it just so happen that in israel the requirement be that your mother be @/@ be jewish , it be different to requirments in other country but it be no less valid .
read the newspaper today you may have see an article regard a teenager call tariq aziz .
he be part of a scheme organised to document the effect of drone strike , he be give a camera .
on his way to his aunt house he and his 12 year old cousin be slaughter by an illegal cia drone strike .
what the **** be wrong with america ?
who will go to ****ing court because of this ?
no @-@ one cos its america , and they be clearly above the law because they have money .
how the **** can america complain about palestinian home @-@ make rocket when they 're use drone without a care in teh world ?
why do america have the right to ****ing attack anywhere its want without any accountability ?
it 's not a bloody cod killstreak .
why when they kill civillians do they have the cheek , to quote the time article to say ' they 're have be no collateral damage in drone attack ' when accord to the time again there be picture of incinerate young children ?
now do you understand why many people , especially muslims have a gripe against the americans ?
at least most muslims be sane , unlike the american goverment who just can n't seem to stop commit terrorist act .
i 'm sorry for the swear , i 'm not one to usually swear , but the cia et al be a joke .
why the negs ?
the kill of this and several other innocent be okay ?
if iran sent a little drone to america and do the samething , what would the ramifcations be ?
what would the outcry be like..?
op i suggest that you watch the documentary ''secret pakistan'' on bbc iplayer and then come back to argue .
this suppose ally of the usa be train and prepare innocent afghan children who be too young to understand islam properly to go into a busy afghan bazaar to blow up innocent afghan civilian .
this be what pakistan deserve for fund lunatic islamic rebel since the the 1960 s against any afghan government that have exist .
it be the price pay for the two million dead afghans during the soviet occupation and the civil war which porkistan fund .
the truth be , every time these drone hit , they kill maybe 10 % terrorist ( at max ) and 90 % civilian .
each of this civilian be a real human with real emotion , not just a statistic .
for instance , a 10 year old kid see their father blown to piece , you expect them to love the americans ?
they become radicalised and ready to murder americans at any cost .
america strategically target civilian so they have a reason to stay there due to further radicalisation of youth .
i try to watch the program " secret pakistan " but the question i keep ask be why ?
in the first ten - twenty minute they never explain why pakistan would want to double cross .
now do n't get me wrong there will be people within the intellilgence who be double cross and have a secret agenda .
but to the highest level as a whole why would the government want such destabilisation from all angle .
the president be corrupt and money hungry but i would say that there be plenty of easier way for him to do that if he so please and put the country into turmoil and him in a terrible light would surely be foolish .
and re the whole drone thingn i really struggle to understand how they can be justify at all .
when lot of people in usa die in 2001 they feel angry , agrieved and wwant revenge .
to do this they go on a long war result in thousand of death and also do not take regard for country ' sovereignty .
now again a lot if not the majority of death be not cause by the usa directly but a significantly large number be therefore it be still a valid point to raise .
i would love to know how a usa citizen would react if bomb be drop on their home town by a foreign country .
i 'm sure they would be happy to forget it and want no justice .
you know what i love ?
all these people say ohh , you be create the terrorism !
well , we would n't be do anytyhing be it not for the terrorist in the first place .
and what cause have they ?
they do n't like american foireign policy .
so instead of go to a parliment meet , they go to armory and decide to blow **** up and kill innocent .
you want someone to blame for the death of civilian in iraq , afghanistan and pakistan , look no further than muslim terrorist .
i think most people be look at this , again , without an objective analysis of the situation .
ever since the intervention in afghanistan and drone attack of pakistan , can anyone give me a successful attack by al @-@ qaeda on the west since the intervention ?
some people should know better that the unite state and her ally be not on some mission to kill innocent civilian , quite the contrary .
most of the contribution in this topic have fail to recognize that islamic fundamentalist have be operate in pakistan and be the root cause of terrorism in that area .
in 2006 , pakistan see 657 terrorist attack leave 907 people dead .
in 2007 , pakistan see 1,503 terrorist attack , result in 3,448 casualty .
in 2008 , pakistan see 2,148 terrorist attack , result in 2,267 casualty .
in 2009 , pakistan see 2,586 terrorist attack , that result in 3,021 fatality .
terrorist attack have kill over 35,000 people .
if we compare this to figure of civilian casualty ( which i will go into ) it be quite a healthy ratio as of the 1658 to 2597 kill , 385 be think to be civilian , in contrast of the taliban @/@ al @-@ qaeda 's operation to kill civilian .
interestingly , the number of terror attack in pakistan drop which can prove to be conclusive evidence of the effect on al @-@ qaeda and taliban leadership and their effective operational capability that be decrease .
one can logically say these drone attack be work , which be report on both side if you look at the current fragmentation of al @-@ qaeda and asscoatied jihadist sect leadership operate on the afghan @-@ pakistani border .
from a strategy perspective , in 2009 and 2010 , air drone be equip with new missile call small smart weapon ( ssw ) or typically know as ' scorpion .'
these missile have increase accuracy and expand surveillance , include the use of small , unarm surveillance drone to pinpoint the exact location of target .
ever since the introduction of civilian causality countermeasure technology , bloomberg report that 1,300 militant be kill and only 30 civilian kill in drone attack in mid @-@ 2008 .
the new america foundation believe that civilian casaulties have decrease from 25 % to an estimate 6 % , with a total of 18 civilian kill since august 2010 .
on the ground of legality , accord to the geneva convention , member of regular arm force - involve in conflict - be the only person who may be consider lawful combatant and authorised to use lethal force .
the operator in pakistan be the unite state ( usaf ) and the pakistani military .
so , who really murder more ?
islamic fundamentalist group total of 35,000 casualty ( since 2003 ) or the unite state ' 385 casualty ( since 2004 )?
why can n't people think the same thing ? if it be two american kid dad there would be media furore .
i do n't see these two kid name on the news ?
yet we see soldier who make a choice to go and fight on the news when they die .
actually , it do
that be the very definition of democracy , if something pass by the tiniest fraction of a percent need then everyone and everything else can be ignore .
of course this be not how we work , but then you can n't start say we 're undemocratic because people do n't turn out for the vote , that be their problem , not the government .
and please don ; t get start on the coalition .
it be democratic because together they recieved more vote than labour , so they have a right to power .
right , so to you there 's no difference in blow up 100 's of civilian in a crowd market place , and blow up a build but phone the threat in beforehand to minimise civilian casualty ? in that case , it 's ok every , bishy just basically say collaterol damage do n't exist for any western force as there 's no distinction between force use . let 's start bomb civilian area , it just do n't matter apparantly and of course , i do n't condone either group , afterall , the ira 's aim be only achieve after they lay down their arm .
no more than it be for someone to blow you up .
there seem to be a misconception hold by some that america be not a welfare state .
do anyone know the percentage of gdp they spend on welfare and benefit of all kind compare to say britain or the scandanavian nation ?
- who be usually consider the biggest welfare state in the world .
edit :
ok , so i have have look today and it look like america spend 46 % of its budget on welfare programme .
59 % if you add pension .
look at this chart here from the us government spend website .
it have 24 % health , 22 % pension , and 13 % welfare .
be that how to work it out ?
http : //www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_spending
yes , a lot of money ( read . too much money ) be spend on ss etc.
however , the taxation rate on average be still 10 % higher at least in european nation .
this be why we need a republican government to try and decrease our ridiculous government spend .
republican do nothing but spend money , and fight war --- and encourage war --- and spend more money try to put americans in a constant state of fear .
republican be a joke
apparently 44 % of americas budget be spend on medicare @/@ medicaid and social security which be a joke consider how naff american welfare be
suppose you get a letter that state you must attend a month of military train before you be send to iran/zimbabwe/syria to protect the civilian from oppression .
it must be on ground to minimise civilian casualty .
your friend be go to protect these civilian too .
do you go or do you sacrifice your dignity ?
this be a " humanitarian " mission after all .
not go would in no way sacrifice your dignity .
what if you have three children to fee ?
how would make the choice not to leave them alone and destitute mean you surrender your dignity .
this be nonsense .
in answer to the more general question you be try to pose : no , i would n't .
anybody who do such work deserve all of our respect ( assume no ulterior motive ) but it be n't for everyone , and that do n't make somebody a bad person .
i would protect my family and friend , i have no interest in personally protect strangers...
i 'm not here to save the world , in no way do that decision impact my dignity
in 1951 libya be the poorest country in the world , before the nato intervention libyans enjoy the highest standard of live in africa .
in libya , home be consider a human right .
newly marry couple receive $ 50,000 to buy their own home and electricity be free for all .
im not make all this up
gaddafi vow to house every libyan before his own parent , he keep his promise and his own father die before he be able to be house .
before gaddaffi , less than 1 @/@ 5 th of libyans be literate .
now education be free and high quality .
literacy rate be now 83 % .
healthcare be also free .
if libyans cannot find the education or healthcare they need in libya the government unds them to go abroad to access it .
all loan be interest free by law .
if a libyan buy a car , the government pay 50 % of the price .
the price of fuel be $.14 a gallon .
any libyan wish to become a farmer be give free use of land , a home , equipment , livestock and seed .
on july 1 sr 2011 , 1.7million people assemble in green square , tripoli to show defiance against the nato bomb of libya .
this represent around 95 % of the population of tripoli .
the libyan central bank be state own and unlike bank in the west be now own by the elite or ridden by debt .
gaddafi didnt have to drive around in libya with 8 inch thick glass or a tank like obama do ,
search youtube , theres plenty of video of him beign drive around wave and shake hand of the dozen of people run after him .
2 year ago western leader all over the world praise him .
yes gaddafi have be accuse of some terrible thing , but look at the thing western leader do all of the time .
the second he start give out oil contract to russia @/@ asia he be oust .
disgust .
ok , cool story , but here 's some fact :
1. he start a war in chad - a crushingly poor nation that be in the middle of a civil war at the time - with the intent of establish a puppet jamahiriya that he could control .
thankfully he fail after chad , with the assistance of france , expel his force .
2. he start this war in chad by lure immigrant from pakistan and poor sahelian nation to libya with the promise of civilian work , and then press @-@ ganging them into fight as the islamic legion .
many legionnaires be still a major threat to peace and stability in central africa today , specifically in darfur where they be now know as the janjaweed .
perhaps you 've hear of them ?
3. he directly fund terrorism against the unite kingdom in the form of the ira , which he also train and equip , and sponsor other act of international terrorism such as the lockerbie bomb .
4. he embezzle billion of dollar of public money to fund a lavish , dictatorial lifestyle for him and his family .
5. he illegally proliferate nuclear weapon , chemical weapon and biological weapon in flagrant violation of international law .
6. any political dissent within libya be brutally repress by the khamis brigade , directly lead by khamis gaddafi - one of his son , and compose of foreign mercenary willing to do anything against the libyan people for their next payslip .
7. libyan political refugee be assassinate by the state as a mean to oppress the opposition to his rule .
if you have any love lose for this man you be a terrible human be .
i think he do that to keep his people happy so that people would be less likely to oppose him or he start out good genuinely want to help his people but become obsess with power .
so vile .
how can a country like the usa , relatively liberal and tolerant , have such a powerful party of extremist ?
britain have nothing to match the republican party , on social issue , apart from perhaps the bnp - but even they do n't hate on gay as much as the republican party do .
in 2011 , how can americans even think of vote in such a party ?
it 's disgust .
shame on the republican .
it 's an incredibly religious country @- and a very evangelical one at that .
as much as i hate their attitude , you need to understand that it 's just the way they 've be bring up to think
that be say , it be still shock that this type of discrimination still exists...
the people who get involve in politics to the degree of go to debate be , thankfully , not representative of the majority of people over there .
do n't stop them be dick , though
and ? this be surprise ?
it 's know that the usa be n't as progressive as western europe with regard to gay right and attitude towards gay people .
to be fair , santorum be probably just a confused idiot .
he say that sex have no place in the military and orientation be irrelevant , which i agree with .
but then he say he 'd bring dadt back , which be disagree with .
but the boo of the soldier be terrible make no mistake .
if a gay soldier be better than , or just as good as a straight soldier , then it make no difference what their sexuality be .
at the end of the day , if i be serve on the front line with other troop , i 'd want the best troop , not the straightest .
what make me laugh be that the usual anti @-@ american crowd have jump on this thread with all the " vile " and " disgust " comment .
the same crowd that get into a lather about the evil empire of israel and the poor palestinians blahblahblah .
the usa have legalised gay marriage in some state , and federal equality law . sure , some people be n't up with that - but that 's freedom for you .
contrast this with the wonder of the palestinan authority , where it be a criminal offence to be gay and punishable by imprisonment .
you hear a lot of criticism of israel - but if you have to , would you rather live there or one of its close neighbour ? bear in mind israel 's freedom , prosperity , etc.
note : i know some of the country do n't physically neighbour israel , but they be extremely close so they count .
eygpt , probably because they 're comparitively level and calm . ( i say comparatively ) .
for religious , political and social freedom . israel
because it 's the most westernised , israel .
i know a lot of lebanese people and let me tell you , they 're the most fun love person i have ever meet .
really open @-@ mind and peaceful .
it look really beautiful too !
israel because its the least likely country to get bomb and invade by israel
jordan or israel .
plus to all the people say egypt , really ?
its future be very uncertain and christians ( assume some of you be ) be routinely not treat properly .
i really have no idea why -- unless you be a devout muslim -- you would choose saudi arabia over israel .
unless you have no care for any of your freedom .
and before anyone make any sarcy comment about israel , at least a woman can drive there..
none , when i be in cyprus the heat be too annoy , so i 'd rather not reside in that region .
lebanon . beirut be a relax , westernised place and the party capital of the middle east
cyprus... what ?
its only a little swim away i 'd call it a neighbor , live there for 2 year , lovely , go for a swim in the sea catch some ray on the saturday , then off to build a snowman on troodos on the sunday , great little island .
i see the news story about the submariner who went on a kill spree on a nuclear submarine and it worry me quite a bit .
be it realistic that in the next 30 year there 'll be worldwide dismantlement of all nuclear weapon intend for kill other human ?
never hopefully .
nuclear weapon have keep the world superpowers from wipe each other out
the submarine be just power by a nuclear reactor , it fire non nuclear warhead .
the day they 'll be get rid of be the day something more powerful be invent .
we have every reason to hope that do n't happen , tbh .
why would government and company in certain country sell arm to an offensive country when they attack a country they dislike but then attack that country when it attack a country they do like
this be double standard !
i be talk about the iraq before and during the gulf war .
iraq attack iran then government were happy to sell weapon to iraq include uk , france , us , west germany , italy , china and soviet union .
some of them be even sell to both side such as us , soviet union and china .
a small minority sell only to iran these be north korea and surprizingly israel accord to israel ( although iran deny this ) .
why would all these country be happy for iraq to go on the war path and to fund both all side of the war yet go after iraq when it start on kuwait ( although they leave saddam in power ) .
my thought be that government simply let their private arm company make a bit of cash off the war like they usually do .
they use their puppet government of the shah and saddam to control the country to counter soviet influence in the region .
when the islamic revolution happen the us lose all their influence over the nation so after iraq begin their attempt invasion they happily cast a blind eye in order to regain influence .
then when they see saddam invade country they already have influence in kuwait they finally take action although they leave him in power as the soviet be still there and would n't want iraq to become communist .
then 12 year later there be no long a soviet union but they notice a strengthen iran that be a potential threat to their ally israel so when some they get some ' evidence ' of iraq with nuclear material from a known unreliable source via mi6 they jump with joy to invade it .
it be a win win for their publicity they either take out evil dictator saddam or they stop iraq get nukes .
then they build up their base in iraq and fund a new government to counter the threat of iran as they lose all influence upon iraq when they stop them in the first gulf war .
these war be just way to prevent other nation gain any sort of power whether it be directly or indirectly as well as make their arm company some major money on the side .
so if you still think the us and co be the just and honourable government they claim to be why would they allow company to fund two side of a war ?
why would they go to war over an ideology ?
why would they only take action when a puppet state be invade ?
well , what be you propose to replace it with ?
because government change every 4 year in most place and every government tend to pursue a different policy .
blair sell gun to gaddafi and cameron help oust him , you can n't look at it as if cameron be bind or responsible for the action of blair
a country action should n't ( and luckily don't ) depend on moral standard .
it be naive to think they should .
there be far more important political and economical reason for military intervention or political sanction .
i certainly do n't , they 're mostly hypocrite .
if only we could make the leader look right into the eye of every civilian they kill , maybe the fight and war would stop .
obviously i know it never will , but i can dream .
there be so much discussion these day about race , muslims , etc that i get the feel there be underlie problem .
personally i feel sorry for them ( non white and muslims ) as they bear the brunt of these discussion .
or be we just in denial of racial and ethnic problem in society ?
''learn from history'' - yes , and it teach us ''multiculturalism'' actually always fail .
i do however believe we could get along together , if we figure out how .
douchebags like this be give a forum to air their view be fan a lot of contagious stupidity
well this be the case no matter the denial .
its funny , when muslims plant bomb , the first thing people say be , ' why do they do this ? ', well , fair enough , because its better to understand motive , the same apply to the growth of nationalism in europe .
many factor be at play , anti white racism , immigrant crime which target white people disproportionally , mass invasion immigration policy , abuse of immigration and welfare system .
it be no use just blame ' racism ' as it miss the issue .
so everyone be just get along fine ,
regardless of race , religion , nationality and ethnicity etc ?
i do n't think that be true either
i 'm as right @-@ wing as they come , but why be the british keep hold of island that be not theirs ?
they be thousand of mile away .
i long for the day that the island be reunite with argentina and diplomatic relation between britain and argentina can resume .
what be your thought ?
when hell freeze over .
when the falkland islander decide they want to be argentinian .
they be quite fond of be british right now .
be this another name for the falklands ?
as i understand it , the inhabitant of these island feel a strong sense of britishness , and want to continue to remain british .
the island belong to the islander , not argentina , and if the islander say they want to be argentinian , or independent , then the island would cease to be british .
can you not understand the difference between an individual in one country want to be a citizen of another ( basically a wannabe migrant ) and a state wish to retain its territorial status ?
in your american example , that 's the difference between a dude in azerbaijan say " i want to be american - why can n't i ? " and hawaii say " we want to remain part of the us ".
that 's true ; the oil in the falklands be not a major factor .
although i do believe that if the majority of islander wish to be british we should keep the island .
when we get ireland ' back '.
i mean they in no way want to be part of the uk , but they 're right next to us , so they should be...
why do the term ' las malvinas ' even exist ?
why do n't i just call argentina ' dickhead land '.
also , op , ignorance much ?
they already belong to the uk and the uk grant them local governance .
so technically they already belong to their owner .
they never be unite with argentina
the problem with this logic be there be more than enough people who think differently to cover the cost - and they ( or anyone in fact ) could n't care less what you think .
they will be pay for the defence themselves if with the oil revenue as well so there will be even less reason for you to complain in the future .
i have to write about the imfs involvement in current affair for school , i must have be live under a rock for the past few month because i have no idea at all as to what the imfs involvment with greece be , ive try to google it but all the different information be confuse me , can anyone explain please ?
they be call in when country fail to run their economy properly .
of course eurocrats fail to see what be happening... what do you expect from hansomly @-@ pay , non @-@ audit people resposible for other @-@ people 's money ?
like the fall of the roman empire , the whole mess be gonna get worse .
in may china 's cpi go up by 5.5 % year @-@ on @-@ year , 5.3 % in city and 6.0 in rural area .
attention that the food price go up by an astonish 11.7 % .
this be definitely increase the pressure on its economic growth .
everyone have his @/@ her point of view .
that 's only a percentage point higher than the uk , but unlike us they have double digit economic growth so have plenty of room to work with .
i mean , if inflation be 5.5 % but the economy grow 10.5 % , that 's net wealth creation of 5 % be n't it ?
or be there something i 'm miss ?
even if the rate of economic growth almost double the rate of inflation , the effect of this high rate of inflation be still prominent ; especially due to china 's very unequal distribution of wealth .
" 5.3 % in city and 6.0 in rural area "
the rural area accomodate many of the peasant in china and as it face such high rise in food price and a 6 % rise in general price , those peasant be go to find it increasingly hard to purchase their commodity .
i be sure many of us be well aware of samuel huntington 's " clash of civilization " theory , that future conflict would be along cultural line between " west ", " east " and " confucian " block , whatever they be .
what do everyone think ?
do the theory hold weight or be it just a product of modern day oriental @-@ ism ?
the op 's mind be move in , in my opinion , the right direction .
conflict be almost always cause by political and economic issue rather than cultural one , even if motive for fight may ostensibly appear to be over religion , for example .
if you have jstor access and have n't read ervand abrahamian 's article on huntington , then i recommend it .
something that caught my eye today .
it seem australia be propose a ban on the cultivation and possession of a range of plant that contain certain psychoactive substance .
these be the plant that be already include in australias ban list :
- all plant in the cannabis genus
- all plant in the erythroxylum genus ( which cocaine be derived from )
- papaver somniferum and papaver bracteatum ( opium poppy )
- all fungi that contain psilocin and psilocybin ( magic mushroom )
these be the plant that would be add to the ban list :
- savia divinorum
- kratom
- khat
- brugmansia
- datura ( the former and latter both common garden flower , but be crap as recreational drug due to their high toxicity . idiot who try it once wont try it again , if they survive.)
- any plant that contain ephedrine
- any plant contain mescaline
- any plant contain dmt ( this be the one i find most absured as there be litterally 100 s if not 1000 s of plant and tree that contain this substance , many grow wild in australia and be commonly use in landscape .
dmt even occur naturally in human and most other mammal , be they go to ban human and mammal too ! ?)
as a horticulturalist myself , i find the australian authority proposal to be highly disturbing .
this be completely pointless legislation , bureaucracy at its finest , that be go to criminalise potentially million of innocent people who work with these plant or grow them ornamentally in their garden .
and just how do they expect to be able to enforce a ban on litterally thousand of species of plant ?
its insanity , you cant legislate nature .
and then of course we come back to the old chesnut ; most of the substance in these propose plant be less harmful and addictive than legal substance , such as alcohol and tobacco .
mescaline and dmt actually cause less harm to the body than caffeine .
anyhoo , rant over .
this article be a few month old , so i dont know if this made it into the law book or if it be throw out , so if anyone have any information id like to hear about it .
heres hope common sense prevail for once .
how do they ban cannabis in australia ?
dosent it grow as a....well wee
it 's your responsibility to use drug sensibly and your choice whether you abuse them or not .
it 's no right of the government or anyone to control what you consume .
i think the government should tackle drug use and damage life by provide support for those who need it , not by criminalising them .
many drug addict get send to prison and be give methadone to ' ease ' their addiction to crack , meth or heroin .
obviously that 's wrong .
=/ that 's the harsh reality of it .
ban the substance in the first place .
it will cause damage now to those addict but better for long term
i do see the value of rehab though
it 's the illegality of drug that make the production , distribution and use of those drug hugely expensive and harmful to everyone .
most of the outlaw drug , if take with a bit of knowledge and awareness , be mostly as harmful , if not much less harmful , than tobacco or alcohol .
what do you think of the first 2012 republican debate on thursday ?
it feature tim pawlenty , ron paul , herman cain , gary johnson , and rick santorum .
it be in the early day , so there be n't that many candidate .
and what do you think of the saturday night live version of the ‘undeclared’ candidate 's debate .
it feature impression of michele bachmann , donald trump , mitt romney , newt gingrich , jimmy mcmillan , and of course , sarah palin play by the legendary tina fey !
i think it be great . pure humour .
edit : mike huckabee be n't in either . hmm....
i like ron paul more and more
herman cain i would support any mean to protect the country . not like the sound of that
the fox news one seem to be let down by the fact that so many of the undeclared big name be n't there ( for the obvious reason that they 're undeclared ) .
ron paul would be the lead runner of those that take part , but the snl people be far more likely to be the main contender .
that say , where be obama this time in the 2008 race ?
notwithstanding a few of his religious nutter @-@ esque social view ron paul be the only republican who actually make sensible point about big government and the only one i have any respect for .
too bad he 's never go to be president give the state of the republican party .
i just see a similar thread on saudi arabia , so i think , why not in pakistan as well ?
i dont need to explain the situation there...... but shouldnt they have a revolution ?
the press be relatively free so people have a medium they can vent through .
there be too many faction that be fight amongst each other - if they unite under a common cause then there would be a serious threat of revolution .
firstly , gaddafi be not an enemy of ours .
secondly , gaddafi be the autocrat of his country , if he wish to stamp out rebellion , it 's his prerogative .
all state hold the right to defend their own interest .
human be cruel , people should get over it , it 's our nature .
additionally , should n't our own arm force be use for national defence only ?
of all of these conflict over the past 20 @-@ 30 year or so , which directly affect our interest :
- the falklands
- the first gulf war ( liberation of kuwait )
- bosnia
- sierra leone
- kosovo
- second gulf war ( removal of saddam )
i would say only the falklands .
the falklands the first gulf war and to an extent the second gulf war .
i see what your say but if we have a chance to help people fight for democracy and not be brutally crush then we should do something .
we rarely get the chance to support rebellion as in most case the rebel be as bad as the government they be fight .
libya can be see as a popular uprise against a tyrant .
no doubt people complain but they would complain if we do nothing to .
no one want to see another rwanda and this event seem to signify a much more proactive right foreign policy from the uk .
and before people shout oil at me .
well you be just go to have to wait until after this end be n't you to see if it be .
frankly i cannot imagine why company would negotiate oil contract only to try to convince the government to invade the country so they lose them .
take some of the responsibility for enforce a no fly zone ( i.e . patrol shoot down any plane which gadaffi use to bomb civilian ) would have be acceptable due to the un resolution and the fact that civilian in benghazi be sit duck .
however , bomb ground troop in order to allow arm rebel to rampage further west be , in my opinion , completely against the spirit of the un resolution .
i increasingly get the impression that the coalition be not protect civilian ( i.e . unarm citizen , not rebel ) but rather be passively support the rebellion by decimate gadaffi 's soldier who , at the end of the day , be just do what they be tell .
it 's easy to shout oil and the fact that it get shout so often mean that it 's also brush off by those support military action , without a thorough evaluation .
oil be not the only reason why the coalition be back the rebel ( and i 'm go to take the plunge now and say that they be ) , but it be certainly a consideration .
gadaffi have state that ( assume he regain control over his country ) he will only sell oil to the russians and the chinese .
the rebel on the other hand have state that they be willing to upgrade oil production in benghazi three @-@ fold .
people can argue that we be do our bit by help out the libyans in their time of crisis .
but why have n't we intervene in the numerous conflict in africa over the past 20 @/@ 30 year
i agree that we should be help out all these innocent people ( im sure if it be the other way around we would want help from more powerful country )
but why there and not in other place ?
i do think our main reason for help be oil and resource , which be pretty much as bad as do nothing as we 're not set the example of help people out in a time of crisis , its more of a " we 'll help but only because we might get something in return "
i know this be just how the world work , but there would be alot less trouble in the world if it wasnt .
anybody who believe the british empire , once again , intervene in yet another country on ' humanitarian ground ' to protect ' innocent civilian ' be absolutely ignorant of history and cannot use mere logic , or at least do not apply it to ' queen and country '.
or , they could be the opposite of independent thinker and accept the propaganda spout by the establishment .
if the rebel be communist , the intervention lead by the unite state , britain and france in libya would not have occur , nor would the rebel opposition be support , have they be communist .
in other word , the intervention in libya be not about protect civilian , but instead entirely about protect interest and side with a candidate whom the ' coalition ' prefer .
if this be not the case , the unite state would be intervene exactly how they be today in libya , even if the rebel have be the taliban .
furthermore , britain and france have always state from the very begin that they be willing to intervene in libya without the approval of the unite nation .
yet the justification they keep use for this intervention be to ' enforce humanitarian law authorised by the unite nation '.
to be blunt while be honest...
history will show once again , that the real reason for this capitalist @-@ lead intervention in libya be not about ' defend innocent people '.
and when it do , all those who support this intervention should be hold accountable for their ignorance and the crime of strengthen a system which have consistently prove , through its billion of dead victim , to be the greatest monster this world have ever see .
ok guy , we 've see how the egyptians successfully bring mubarak down and at the same time theres also a lot of protest goin around the middle east country ; tunisia , bahrain , algeria etc.....
although it may not seem like it have nothing to do with religion , just politics...i feel like the world be come to an end or something cause muslims be finally take a stance for their rights....
after this , what next ?
be just wonder could there be an islamic revolution perhaps in the near future where the world be like come to an end ? ??
this be probably a really stupid question but just give me some feedback about this matter
the answer be no.
guys..i know its a bit tedious but im just wondering..
if you guy can be bother than dont bother read it then !
god willing , yes , if only to overthrow the corrupt government in place in these country .
none of these protest be islamic in nature .
they tend to be secular leaderless and make u mostly of the young .
what be wrong with muslims speak up for their right ? ??
explain yourself .
and as far as an islamic revolution be concern i would say that it depends on how organize religious or clerical organization be in a country and how politicized they be .
any analysis on the issue can n't be a one size fit all jacket since the nature of the protest vary in all say country .
it apeas noth korea have start enrich uranium at a brand new plant that apparently be very modern .
seem odd they could build this . im bet on a lot of chinese maybe even russia help .
it would appear they be go to ake more nukes .
ok so what be your thought on this ?
are they a danger ?
will this change anything ?
could we see a much more aggressive north korea ?
or will nothing change ?
i very much doubt russia would be involve in this .
china be sympathisers with the communist regime so possibly link there .
there 's very little anyone can do about it because bomb their nuclear facility will result in seoul be obliterate and most of south korea be destroy without nukes .
the only hope be if dear leader 's son allow change but do n't hold your breath .
hey guy , read the news daily , i can n't help but notice that occasionally , the western media ( cnn and sometimes bbc ) picture china as a country who be heartless , have no respect for human right , dictatorship etc.etc .
however , this past summer , i go to china for holiday , and it be nothing like the western media picture it to be , the people all seem to enjoy life , no sign of human right abuse ( i traveled to tibet to , the people seem happy ) .
i can n't help but feel that the western media be portray only one side of the story ( tibet ) ,when in reality we brits have also invade tibet and the world say nothing .
i see that we be afraid of a communist country rise , and i know they be n't the nicest people , but neither be we when we colonize 1 @/@ 4 of the world , or when the americans drive the indians off their land .
are we right to be complain about china when we do n't have a clean record either ?
do you think that the western media be demonizing china ?
as a westerner , do you think china be a cold , heartless dictatorship ?
i 'm half chinese and the western media be definitely demonizing china .
the chinese government have more support from its people than the british government do .
when the west criticize china about its lack of democracy of human right abuse it 's usually only the west who have a problem with it and not the average chinese person .
and why be these clown always complain about tibet ?
the fact that they do n't care about uyghurs just show what hypocrite and bigot they be .
that 's because whenever a chinese person do complain they get thrown in prison or shot .
china 's record on human right be appal look at the one child policy that be cause major gender imbalance problem as well as be brutally implement , force sterliseation and such .
although i do n't criticise it on democracy as democracy be always right or good .
as for the more popular than the british government source ?
the media demonoising china be just what the media do , it demonises everything its how they sell paper with horror story .
even if they get nukes iran be still heavily outmanned , outgunned and isolate .
their nukes wont be as good as american and european nukes .
their uav 's wont be as good as isreali and american uav 's
their missile will barley cross their own border before they be shot down by a multitude of defence the usa have already be prepare in the middle east for the past god know how long .
the only thing the extremist muslims can possibly do be blow themselves up in our border .
and they have fail that more than enough time .
iran be a empty threat .
iran with nukes however will unify and strengthen the resolve and moral of the muslims
iran want to portray itself as the ' hero ' of the muslims against the western infidel by have nukes and defy the usa .
so the more we talk about it , the more coveradge they get and the more muslim extreamists will orgasm at the sound of usa 's threat .
so let ignore iran , they be like the kid in primary school with the attention seek problem .
meh maybe if the came clean with their nuclear program and would accept help that the rest of the world be offer .
if they be so peaceful why not allow un inspector in .
the problem be n't that they could potentially outmatch us in term of nuclear capability .
the problem be that its monstrous regime will become more stable , and will be able to dictate the rest of the world 's policy towards it .
plus , one must consider the potential ramification of thermonuclear weapon fall into the hand of a regime run by the clergy ; a clergy that have repeatedly lay claim to the island nation of bahrain , support nasrallah 's thuggish militia in lebanon , make continual reference to the apocolypse and the return of the ' twelfth imam ', and so on .
that 's without go into how it will make a complete mockery of international law and non @-@ proliferation .
australia should become a republic when queen elizabeth ii die , prime minister julia gillard have say just day ahead of a general election .
welsh @-@ born ms gillard say the queen 's death would be an " appropriate point " for australia to move away from have a british monarch as head of state .
australians vote against become a republic in a 1999 referendum , but the issue continue to be divisive .
so , who think australia would vote for a republic ?
it 's up to them if they wish to sever the bond that unite their heritage , history , and present .
i do n't think the issue be that they have a hereditary monarch , but the fact that the hereditary monarch in question be a ' foreign ' one ( yes , i be aware she be queen of australia in her own right , but you know what i mean ) .
i think they should keep the monarchy...
the monarchy exist here for the same reason it do over there .
heritage , history and present , as the above poster rightly say .
it 's not a drain on their economy and their power and sovereignty be n't be control in real political term .
i do , however , agree with the propose flag change , if that 's what australians want .
hold another referendum !
are we witness a new era of repression .
in the past nation would develop new technology to dominate its rival , however with recent attempt to prevent iran from develop nuclear technology be we see powerful nation use economic terrorism ( sanction ) and war to prevent other nation from develop technology to compete .
for a nation with civilian and military nuclear technology to essentially deny another nation the same right to develop technology it be clear that the old guard of westenr power be try to prevent emerge power from develop the same level of technology .
how can iran stake its claim to its right ?
economic terrorism ( sanction ) be essentially a way to ruin an economy its a modern day version of a seige and an act of war .
the sanction place on iran be design to appear to target only military group but with research you will see it massively target civilian business , infrastructure and even the attempt of iranian student to study outside of iran .
this be an all out attempt to cut of irans blood flow and crush this nation .
what should other nation learn from this ?
other develop nation would be wise to realise that western power have a stake in prevent the development of nation they consider inferior particularly asian , african and south american nation .
this realisation should make them realsie they must band together to defeat this racist threat .
i would suggest an economic block and the share of nuclear technology within this block to ensure their sovereignty from both military and economic war .
america have a vest interest in keep certain nation poor and weak but with solidarity and strength these nation can rise up and defy this evil threat .
hmm here be a country that generally do n't like me should i let them build a big nuclear weapon they can kill me with ?
*thinks hard*
iran will get destroy by the israelis before it have a chance to get a nuclear weapon , and if israel be unable to do so then the israeli race would be ( excuse the pun ) exterminate .
how can you be in favour of this ?
you make it out like hamper a nation development be somthing new !
since the dawn of civilization country and province have sort do out do each other and gain from others weakness .
you say it be crazy that america force sanction on iran , yet it be not in their economic or defence interest to allow this to happen so in fact it be perfectly sane .
if iran be to develop nuclear weapon , they would use them , and they would , theoretically , become the powerhouse in the middle east .
this be against us forgien policy for two reason , firstly they need to secure the safty of the oil field in the middle east , and secondaly an anti @-@ western superpower in the middle east will more likely that not attract the back of china , who already have make it perfeclty clear that they be inforcing their dominance over africa .
the combination of an iranian @-@ chinese block in asia and africa would seriously threatern the us and the whole western world .
thus , it be just and need for the us to impose such sanction on iran .
if ahmadinejad do say this , do he have any info as to what be gonna go down ?
do you think the americans will strike other me country in the run up to the iran attack or simulataneously strike ?
could be syria perhaps ?
just hope we do n't get drag into this war ; we can n't even deal with the taliban...
let the american @/@ israelis deal with it !
there 's nothing about it on the bbc , but yes , a strike be inevitable .
i highly doubt the americans @/@ israelis will strike any other middle eastern country , in fact , i cannot see it happen whatsoever .
the unite kingdom will do exactly as the unite state say because of this idiotic perception that both of our nation share a ' special relationship '.
the unite kingdom will be drag into it , you can bet your bottom dollar on that .
substantial evidence have be present to prove large quantity of deplete uranium ( du ) have be use in iraq since the invasion in 2003 .
[edit] ok since alot of people think the ' tehran time ' be untrustworthy i will give another source which give the same information about liam fox 's statement .
i can n't bring myself to understand this in any way .
i remember see some picture of deformity a little while back and could n't even believe it be humanly possible .
they disturb for a few day after and that 's from someone who be n't easily upset .
back then i always believe that the leader of our militaries would never allow this .
they would never allow generation of iraqi 's to suffer from mutation and deformity like these .
i pass it off as propaganda at the time but now the evidence seem substantial and clear that this be exactly what happen .
what be the most upset be that our tax fund this .
our tax cause girl to be born with two head like something straight out of a horror film .
how can this ever be rectify ?
how can you explain to the children why they be born with paralyse limb or be born with their eye form inside out ?
how can you rectify a system which have do to iraq what it 's do over the decade .
from support tyrant , to watch on and do nothing , to several large scale war , to cripple sanction .
what harm be they afraid of from these ordinary , poor iraqis .
you can n't rectify .
that 's ******* disgust and i hope the perpertrators be make to suffer what generation of iraqi 's already have and will ever endure .
remember those who champion themselves on human right be actually the biggest terrorist in the world .
certain place like fallujah , tikrit , mosul atc , baathi scum stronghold deserve it for what they do to iraq and the iraqi people under saddam 's( may god curse him ) regime .
that 's ******** for a start the us would not a shell a town with du , it 's high density mean it be use for penetrator core for armour pierce sabot round , to be use against tank .
it 's a kinetic energy round and would serve no purpose other than in a pitched tank battle , of which there be n't that many in gw2 .
and that 's the independent article , i do n't even need to bother try to discredit something from the ' tehran time '.
well that 's war be n't it ?
never like it but when war happen you have to expect any atrocity .
they want to sue the uk and us ?
it be a ******* war we would be stupid to give them money because they will only use it for weaponry to fight against our arm force and they will probably plant some du in our country or even nuke us innocent civillians for payback .
sure we all want war to be just and we all think nothing like this should happen , but you 'd be naive to think this be possible and this be how a war should be conduct .
it 's a ******* war .
do n't tell me muslim country like iran and pre @-@ war iraq would n't invoke such method if they could .
apology for be so inevitably stupid but...j am i wrong in think superpowers be judge by their worth , their gdp ?
if so , how can china overtake the us even as it grow in this area ?
it be still way off the us gdp .
i know the us have a lot of debt , and a great deal of it be owe to china
also , be n't japan ahead of china in term of gdp ?
when you have 1 billion+ people , its almost impossible not to become a super power...even if your army be fight with sword and bows....cos it simply be n't possible to win against the sheer amount of number
true , thank for that .
but it 's not like their population swell overnight , or be it ?
i 'm just try to find out more about the subject really..
imo : grow military strength , economic potential and influence in international affair make a superpower .
its their industry , cheap labour , huge workforce , investment in technology and hard work nature .
china be invest in the future , we here in britain really be not...
china be go for it headlong and because of this be develop more and more and discover new thing .
china also have less strict law on what not to do...i.e they will test and fund thing that we have regulation against .
they have huge industry which they dont care much in the way of climate problem .
they have a massive population ready for any dirty job .
finally , they be a hard work people with dedication and less slobby
do we really want another superpower ?
compare to the others , china look like a bunch of savage : disgust human and animal right record and a lack of freedom .
the gdp be rapidly rise each year .
lol @- russia 's economy be less than half the size of france and germany 's and almost half as small as the uk 's .
couple with the fact that the country have just be through a huge reccesion that have wipe off more than 10 % of its gdp , and that it be fall to piece through political instability , i think im right to say its a joke @- not to mention the fact that its entire economy be based around export natural resource that will soon run out .
it also worth mention that as soon as conventional oil reserve run out , the us and canada will have by far the biggest reserve in the world in the form of oil shale etc.
did you just refer to information from wikipedia in your argument ?
and some be sort of mutually intelligble .
they all share the same write language though which i reckon distinguish from most other language .
worthy enough of call each sub @-@ language a dialect i 'd say .
china already be a super power ; us monetary policy be practically dictate by china .
if they want to crap all over the $ they could do it on a whim - no other country on the planet have the ability to do so , let alone devalue their currency to such an extent it make their export look ridiculously cheap .
china in the global market .
it be a superpower without question .
however to be a super @-@ power you do n't strictly have to be a develop economy .
china be decade from be as developed as the us , regardless of the amount of money they have - chinas greatest compromise be time .
major city be much closer to their western counterpart , however it be beyond where the issue lie in chinas push as a credible economic entity .
what... so because i referred to wikipedia somehow my argument be null and void ?
seriously get a clue .
i get a few chinese people tell me that china will be #1 in the future .
a few year back , newsweek magazine publish article about china 's become the next big thing .
hard to tell but anything be possible .
i bet soviet union have no idea they 'd be perish in the late 80 s @-@ early 90 s .
like some people say this in thread , us won't allow it .
us want to be the only example that represent democracy ( iraq be replace with democratic system , etc ) .
because china be a communist country , it would be harder for them to influence other country politically like how great britian influence its idea to different region of the world ( us in language , hong kong in legal structure and language , etc ) .
30 @-@ 40 year be a very long time , i 'm not deny that china have potential and could potentially become the most powerful country in the world .
notice the world could in bold , some people would argue that if it continue this growth it would become the world 's most powerful country , both economically and militarily even i can see that , but the us will inevitably interfere , because it simply do n't want competition , it want to remain be the biggest , baddest dude on the block , and with china arrive on the world stage( i.e the new kid on the block ) there 'll inevitably and undoubtably be confrontation .
i think china will become the world 's second largest economy - perhaps even the largest , i think china will become very strong militarily - perhaps not as strong as the us as it be light year behind , but still strong , perhaps even stronger than all of europe combine without the use of nukes .
do i think china will become a us type superpower ?
mean that its economy and military be both 10 time stronger than everyone elses - no i do n't , as i 've point out in my previous post , there 'll china will inevitably want to become the regional power of asia , it 'll want to do some land @-@ grab of its own( taiwan for example ) which will lead to its demise .
well i think iran 's only real crime have be defy us energy interest in the region .
we see what happen last time iran defy the us in 1953 under mossadegh , and the result be a cia coup to put in someone who would happily bleed their country dry of their resource .
the us have only themslefes to blame for the move to the theocratical tyranny we see now , and most people would agree iran pose no global threat , but western propaganda represent iran as some nuclear threat have n't be based on iaea report or reason , but as the crescent of the ' axis of evil ',that be those who dare to step out of line .
all road be point towards an attack of some sort .
whether this be jump on the back of a popular revolution , or air strike , who know , but one be for sure ; an attack would have serious implication , and not just the further destablisation of the region .
i do n't think either the us or the soviet union tick the box for me .
neither gain significant land , neither won any significant war ( indeed , the most famous war america be involve in post wwii be vietnam , which they flunk ) - hardly characteristic of a traditional superpower .
superpowers tend to make huge stride in better the life of human civilisation ( the romans do it by further democracy , the british empire do it with the industrial revolution ) .
the us and su certainly do n't make any groundbreaking revolution .
these two country be best know for stockpile weapon and race to the moon - not characteristic of be a superpower .
they have the potential military might to rival classic superpowers , but time have change so much that it be just never go to happen .
my professor raise this point this morning in class :
" hundred and thousand of year ago , my family live in norway , in a consequent town where there be family like mine , make a little clan .
we be then chase from norway , because we be invade by norwegians say that we be stranger , while it have be our land for century and century , and we could n't be consider as stranger .
do you ( ask the class ) think that nowadays , i could go back to norway , and chase the people live there , with the only argument that my family live there for hundred of year ?
bear this in mind , do you think that israelians 's motif for go back to their land be sufficient ? "
what do you think of it ?
be he racist , or be he realistic ?
to be honest if norway be the center of his religious belief and if he have be persecute all the year after his family get kick out he would have a different view .
more importantly he be christian - and he be rule by christian government .
plus if you look at it from his point of view .
conquest determine land hold .
his family be in norway , they get conquer and so cease to own the land .
well the arabs that use to live in israel get ' conquer ' per se - although a much more benign version of conquest - and so no matter what the original motive for the conquest be , they lose the right to that land .
he be neither racist nor realistic - just wrong .
well , be they ?
i 'm use extremist lightly , i 'm just use the word as something to categorize them .
as in group like bnp , nazis and extremist muslims or any partly aggressive religion , could they all be count as bad as each other ?
they can all inspire hate , change story and have radical @/@ controversial view .
so could they be deem on the same level ?
nazis exterminate jews...
extremist muslism would liek to convert everyoen else...
and bnp just want to deport foreigner elsewhere...
so no not really .
hate ( although i believe broadly be a bad thing ) be something i can live with...
change story ?
if you mean lie , then yes that be bad
radical @/@ controvesial be n't bad because they 're radical , they 're bad because of the belief itself .
why ? why do the public @/@ media favour islamic country over jewish one ?
what have the jews ever do compare to muslims ?
i mean come on...this seriously baffle me .
the bbc be biased against america , and therefore israel .
it 's not really about muslims vs . jews .
this be not true at all .
during the recent attack on gaza by israel the bbc be the only channel to not broadcast an appeal for the innocent muslims of gaza . even though all other channel do .
they seem to do pretty much the opposite of what you be say .
discuss
only way you have peace be by have a larger stick than the enemy ,
i prefer the u.s to have all the power to say a unstable country like iran .
rock on u.s.a free israel !
no point in discuss this .
i would say ' no ' but they have nuclear weapon and no @-@ one be go to take them away from them .
disclaimer : i be really not an expert on american politics .
so , as well as the presidential election yesterday , american voter could also vote on a lot of state @-@ specific proposition , one of which be california 's proposition 8 .
gay marriage have be legal in california since may , but this proposition be in favour of eliminate the right of gay couple to marry .
it pass .
i be wonder if anyone have any thought on this..
i think its terrible .
they should n't be allow to do an about turn like that for no apparent reason , especially give the fact that it only recently become allow .
they could have at least give it a chance first .
it 's just even more of a shame that , at a time when america appear to be turn a new leaf , there 's still so many people with this frame of mind .
it just really bug me that it get turn round so soon as well..
gay couple should be allow the happiness that marriage may bring , just like straight couple .
they should have just keep it legal and let those who disagree have a grumble and grind their teeth over it all - it 's not like they 're suffer .
this suprised me to be honest , california have always be know as one of the more progressive state in the union .
the law will probably jump back and forth in the come year .
california have a huge roman catholic population which obviously reject it , not help by the large influx of migrant s @-@ american catholics into the state .
okay yes , true , they be allow .
which do mean people have the right to do them .
but i think the issue of the right to marry be different because people work to get the right and to change the law for it to be allow .
it be n't just a right because no one have tell them they could n't do it , like your example .
i think the issue here be not whether marriage be a right , but whether everyone should be consider equal .
either everyone have the right to marry , or no one do .
just as nobody have the ' right ' to murder ( which quite frankly i find to be a weak argument due to reason already mention ) , either nobody should have the right to marry , or everybody should .
that 's all there be to it .
i would argue that any law that i judge to be unjust be inherently illegitimate and thus i have no moral obligation to follow it or consider it to be a moral principle , nor would i use it to guide my decision make in any more than potentially in a practical sense .
i certainly could not and will not respect the rule of law when it impose restriction on two consent adult express their love , and quite frankly i think that such unjust law undermine the whole system .
you say you have n't consider prisoner not have the vote , and hypothesised that a good reason might be because they should have their right remove for commit a crime .
and the incest argument be entirely relate . if two people be happy together , why can n't they get marry ?
you want one rule for all , stand by what you say , instead of dodge the uncomfortable reality that even you 're not happy with everybody have the same right .
it force school to teach same @-@ sex marriage as a morally equal alternative , cal like the rest of america be full of religious people and they do not see this as right .
it will only take away the right for same @-@ sex couple to call it marriage , everything else be still there .
well , you 're sort of right ; we 're all be treat as second class citizen , but you sort of miss the point .
right have be take away in both instance .
the moral outrage ( here , anyway ) associate with one have not be associate with the other simply because one be acceptable and one be n't ; so it 's not the fact that a right have be take away be wrong , its that you think x should have a right and that right have be take away so you 're annoy .
incidentally ; if you 're white , female , black , communist , jewish , whatever ; you can still not get marry if you 're gay .
if marriage be define as a man and a woman then ban gay marriage be perfectly legitimate .
my point still stand : if you need a certificate from the state to live your life in happiness then you be a.) a pathetic individual and b.) a serf .
so much for the change in america
when be people go to realise that sexual orientation , skin colour and ethnicity have no bear on what be inside the person and their personality .
as long as you a good person , regardless of anything else then that be all that matter .
shame on california - it show what the real attitude on homosexuality be .
people pretend to be fine with it - but their be ignorance deep inside .
what a sad day for " new " america . it seem while racism be rightly widely condemn there be still a lot of homophobia around .
the sad thing be not that many seem to care
personally , i think they should have leave it ( who care about homosexual get marry ? ) but it 's quite common in the us for thing that become law by virtue of court decision to later be subject to public vote .
this be one such case .
gay marriage be never legislate for in california .
this proposition - approve by the public - trump a court decision .
i be read an article about how we need more black sold model for young black people to aspire to .
because apparently , all young black in britain need an extra reminder not to commit crime and be involve in gang .
this highlight a severely racist phenomenon that be consider completely acceptable .
that all these initiative be exclusively targeting young black british people ( in attempt to curb the apparent swarm of exclusively black teenager beg to be part of a gang ) while completely ignore any other skin colour .
now obviously not every black male want to go commit crime all day , and the evidence suggest that black like commit crime just as little as other skin colour do .
so why the disproportionate representation in the media and in crime prevention strategy ?
why do nobody care about crime in the east european , the asian or ( god forbid ) the white community ?
why be nobody say how great a role model plan b be for all the young white kid grow up in council estate .
you can go anywhere in britain and see that gang culture and criminal exist everywhere , in every ethnic group .
logic would dictate that a white orient initiative would make the most sense for demographic reason .
or how about something which do not base its case on skin colour and ethnic origin ?
do people really think that a poor white teenager do n't need support , encouragement or aspiration ?
i completely agree with everything you 've say .
i also think it 's this ridiculous idea that crime in certain ethnic group need to be deal with more urgently that cause more problem .
if the ethnicity and colour of those commit crime be n't mention , it would be much less big a deal . why this country feel the need to consistently talk about the colour of people be beyond me .
it 's like when we beg for asian @/@ black police officer .
if they do n't want to do it , they won't .
we should be judge on our merit , not our skin colour .
i believe it 's thing like this that make white people believe the country be go against them .
if the government do n't deal with thing only to do with race , then i , perhaps naively and idealistically , believe that it would become less of a big deal .
in london , black commit a disproportionate amount of crime .
hence , why they 're targeted .
most gang in london be full of black .
black role model give black people hope .
it 's not about whether it should or why do it , it just do because black community be a semi @-@ community .
totally agree .
poor white people ( pre 20 th century , just poor people ) have be discriminate against for hundred of year in britain .
immigration happen and we 're suddenly part of the oppress class ?
grow up poor and white in a mostly non white school be horrible .
have to learn about the evilness of white people repeatedly really do n't give white kid the impression that they have a place in our multicultural society .
the reason specific ethnic group be targeted for try to reduce crime be because , for whatever reason , crime overall be often higher statistically in these group .
this be not because their race or culture be wrong or bad in any way , it 's simply a fact that certain group have higher rate of crime .
whether it 's the result of poverty or cultural difference and stress in britain that be leave them vulnerable to get lure into crime , pretend that a group that have more prevalence for crime have n't be just foolish .
i do n't know the statistic , but if black youth be the target of an anti @-@ crime and role @-@ model drive , then it 's probably because they have a higher crime rate than other group , and because the government want to make sure that whatever factor it be ( because we know it 's not their race itself ) be address so they can have a better future .
and there be scheme targeting white population , but when there be an imbalance between ethnic group , it surely have to be a priority to address what be cause this imbalance - if for nothing else then for the sake of equality !
there 's a lot of talk recently about how diversity be necessary , but how far do we go ?
and how do we judge what be a good and strong @/@ positive multiracial country ?
when you look at other western country like canada , america , australia , the vast majority of its immigrant be not white these day and be probably head for a more diverse future , so much so to the point that these nation will have very different demographic look to them in 50 year time .
they will have great brag right you could say when it come to multiracialism and diversity than britain or most european country will maybe not have .
you often here quote like " hollywood be too white " " the tories be too white " but what define what be " too white "?
so i 'm wonder if people could put britain in the same context ?
like i say people brand multiracialism as a good thing , very few want to go back to a 100 % white society but how multiracial do we need to go to satisfy the vast majority of people , particularly liberal ?
i personally think it 's completely necessary but i know many of my opponent will disagree .
are we still not multiracial enough compare to some of our western rival ? ?
what do you think ? ?
mate you be all confuse .
when people say " the tories be too white " or " hollywood be too white "
what they mean be " the amount of white people in the tories be disproportionately represent compare to the british population ".
i.e. 14 % of the british population be non @-@ white , but 14 % of the tories be not correspondingly non @-@ white .
there be a bias in representation .
this be bad because it mean certain race be be exclude .
this be completely different to ask whether an entire nation population should be a certain skin colour - skin colour should be irrelevant .
it 's absolutely sicken you would want to diminish a race 's presence just for the sake of it .
the question be pretty , well , questionable
i do n't know of many people who want diversity for diversity 's sake .
the issue with place like " white " hollywood be the glass ceiling that keep minority and women out , as there be the feel ( whether true or not ! ) that there be not a level and fair play field .
funny how people come up with imaginary argument from the " other side ", as i 've never hear any of these " liberal " you refer to .
i think , as usual , you 're frame an argument in a way that will make your so call opinion look bad
if a memeber of your family be go an illegal activty would you conact the police about their action ?
obviously that depends on the activity .
i 'm not go to report my mate for drive at 80 on the motorway but if i suspect he be a serial killer i might be incline to tell somebody
i do n't know if contact the police would be the rationale approach .
i think i would personally confront that family memeber .
if i be unsuccessful i 'd get other family member to help and ultimately if they still refuse to listen -- i 'd leave them to their own accord and let them do what they belive be right or wrong .
because at the end of the day , my conscious would be clear [in the sense that i do try and help them].
tell the police would not be wise , as you 'd be create enemy .
it 'd depend what they be do .
if i do n't think they be harm anyone ( smoke dope , illegally downloading music etc ) then i would n't report them ; if they be hurt other people ( violent crime , theft from individual etc ) then i definitely would .
same go for anyone i be aware of commit a crime , tbh .
i would n't go ' ooh , you 've murder ten people with an axe , but you 're my mum so i won't tell anyone '
the main argument i hear about this issue be that this country be ' full ' or that there 's enough unemployment as it be .
what exactly make people feel that british people deserve to remain in this country more than anyone else who just happen to have be born into poverty or war ?
surely if we 're all equal then no matter where one 's born , they have equal right to live in the uk as someone born here .
i 'm not against immigration but i think it should be more regulate .
why ? because immigration have already cause a lot of " social issue " and until we solve those problem i do n't think its good to just let everyone in .
how should it work : education of english , their intention , and to what they will contribute and most importantly their ideology and belief .
to those whom the welfare state be the biggest concern i think the problem arise from the fact that there be already too many english people sponge off the state and if we add anymore people be it immigrant or " britons " our state of government would collapse and then our economy .
because i wish to protect diversity .
if immigration level be too high , the indigenous population ' gene pool will eventually become so dilute to essentially be extinct .
the cultural and genetic distinction that make the world a diverse , vary and interesting place will be lose , forever .
so that mean that in contrast to the general population they be actually slightly under represented therefore the nhs do not rely on immigrant as much as leftie tsr user claim they do .
well certainly in london they be here .
but to be honest if you live in a village like manchester , anywhere in the south west of england , or anywhere as a matter of fact in the rest of the uk , all you will find be white , but in london you will find ethnic people
besides this be from 2005 , i 'm pretty sure that the figure would be different now .
correct me if i 'm wrong .
the data be nearly 7 year old .
your point that this show that there be n't as many immigrant in the nhs as people think be surely not prove by that data - immigrant can be white e.g. immigrant from italy or poland would be count under the white statistic .
all i see on thestudentroom these day be agitate non @-@ muslims interrogate muslims , criticising their religion ( as any sane person would ) , muslims sign up to the student room just to post some anti @-@ israel propaganda to persuade people about how evil israel be or how islam be the religion of peace
it seem that the blood libel rumour of medeival time that jews kill christian baby to use their blood for wine be today in the form of zionists/jews/israelis kill palestinian baby just because theyre pure evil , and i think the islamic propaganda machine be succeed in convince people ?
anything which take side against muslims get a million negs - its obvious muslims be in a huge presence on tsr .
with a quarter of all primary school children from ethnic minority ( mainly islamic ) be the race @-@ relation and religious demography of thestudentroom a sign of thing to come on a national scale in britain ?
from tsr to a national scale be a pretty big jump do n't you think .
also this be a forum where topic be go to be discuss and these be categorised e.g. religion .
so you have a choice in view these thread and not be part of this so call propaganda .
also in my opinion there be more atheist than muslims on tsr .
and what have jews , zionists and palestine get to do with islam ?
finally " a quarter of all primary school children be muslim ".
i 've be threaten by countless of them on here .
generally they need positive feedback all the time , eithewise they get really agressive .
most of them be racist in my opinion .
agree , if people want to be muslim - then fine .
but when it become their life objective to annoy the life out people with their " read the quaran - or die ! !!" thread , it become a bit annoy -@ _ @-
over the past 1 @-@ 2 year i 've have quite a few discussion with people about current affair ( namely the issue of terrorism and the related issue of immigration , global politics etc ) and quite often hear a common belief that a british civil war will erupt when ethnic minority increase in number and become more estabished .
this beleif be common amonst certain white british nationalist etc...
i do n't believe this will ever happen for various reasons....
do any of you beleive that a british @/@ english civil war will take place ( on the basis of race/identity )?
if so , what do you predict/envisage ?
i believe it will happen ( something similar to what india have now to an israel @-@ palestine type thing ) .
what a ridiculous comparison .
how be it any different ?
the only difference be palestine be still suffer injustice .
as the number of minority group who do n't respect secular law increase they will demand greater autonomy , and mini @-@ vassal state will appear but still remain part of the uk ( like palestine ) and thing will get pretty tense .
so you reckon that first a large imperial power will rule the uk ( like the ottoman rule palestine ) .
this imperial power will be defeat and then power will pass to another power ( like palestine become a british mandate ) .
so you think that an entire group of people be go to move to the uk after a genocide , and then a state will be establish , vote for and partition by the unite nation ?
you then think that neighbouring country will then invade this new state , that the native british people will be force to flee to like cornwall ( gaza ) and yorkshire , lincolnshire , norfolk , suffolk , essex and a part of east london ( west bank ) .
that these british people will form militant group , that want to return to the former england .
that this new state will be support by the usa who will provide it with diplomatic protection and weaponry ?
as i say , absolutely mental to transplant israel @/@ palestine to the uk .
not sure how britain can call itself a civilised country when a woman be rape every 10 minute .
for some people , civilisation seem to rest on how rapist be treat when in custody and not how many rapist actually exist .
i be disgust by modern britain .
something need to be do obviously the easiest way to stop rape be to deal with rapist a lot tough and send out a clear message that it be not acceptable .
at the moment they be give on average 7 year in jail .
its a disgrace .
no other country in the history of the world have be so permissive towards criminal .
britain : weak on crime , tough on the victim of crime .
on a serious note rapist should have longer sentence , i would be happy for them to spend their whole life in prison if it 's beyond practically any doubt they rape someone
i do n't see how tougher prison sentence will prevent rape from occur .
the appellation of ' rapist ' be stigmatising enough ; the scum who rape people clearly do n't care about the consequence .
the sentence rapist and paedophiles ae give be joke .
wow , people be so reactionary .
there be so many different type of rape , and situation , a single life sentance make no sense .
it be a crime of massive degree of difference , i think the mark of a good legal system be that it can deal with every individual crime , rather than simply hand out the same punishment ragrdless of the circumstance .
that say , we could be tougher on all criminal , not just rapist .
and , to put thing into perspective , how often do women have consensual sex ?
what 's that ?
you do n't know(!)
oh well nvm then...
bring back capital punishment .
sorry to have to point out the bleed obvious to the majority of you , but it seem like a minority of user actually have to be tell this : do not make troll post or " joke " about rape , it be n't funny .
for rape ?
are you for real ?
not just rapist , overall perhaps ?
i 'm honestly shock by that number , i would have think it would be more than that .
although that be just the number of report rape , which probably do n't even account for half .
what do you mean by that ?
do you think it 's not one of the most serious crime ?
i keep frequently see thread make hate on islam , which be somewhat hypocritical and disturbing i believe in many case .
i be an atheist ; therefore i be not try to defend islam out of be ' islamic ' before i be accuse of that .
i be also consider by british nationalist to be 100 % british ( although i reject the idea that it make a real difference ) , so i be not show sympathy for islam out of experience similar hostility or racism .
however , i do believe that islam and christianity , along with other major religion , all play very similar and negative role in the world .
therefore , i do not believe we should be cherry @-@ pick islam as some specific evil , but rather oppose all religion for the extremely negative role they play in the world .
the usual argument held against islam be that it be responsible for terrorism .
this may be correct , but the fact of the matter be ; whether somebody be use islam to commit terrible act , regardless of the wrongdoing , all major religion play a large role in shape society , and ultimately , fulfil play a very similar negative role .
and when use the idea that islam ‘inspires terrorism’, if we be honestly that bother about such wrong @-@ do in the world , then we would surely be more concern with end the much more severe crisis 's and wrong @-@ do 's such as starvation and war .
both of these ill be far more widespread and important than the threat of terrorism , as of which we be more like to die by our own hand rather than by the hand of an ' islamic terrorist '.
it be almost unbelievable how the idea that a christian should have any sympathy or support when they proclaim a dislike for islam , when the religion they subscribe to right now in britain , be play a much more negative role .
we should oppose religion simply on the basis that all religion play a negative role .
but we should not bully specific religion because of certain condition and influence of the society we presently live in .
this be of course , an argument only for those who aspire to reason , rationality and evidence in mind .
i have no expectation that i will be receive any support for my remark by christians or other adherent of major religion .
i be an atheist and i think islam be the most inherently evil religion out of all the other one .
i would choose to live in a christian society over a muslim one any day .
as an atheist i can differentiate between islam and christianity , in that christianity be progressive , whilst islam be not .
well to be honest it 's a two head coin .
i completely agree sometimes , there be a horrendously bad labeling of islam unnecessarily .
but sometimes it do no come under as much criticism ( for small case , not the religion as a whole ) as other religion because people just get label racist .
i know everybody be gonna neg me as racist but someone have to say it .
similarly to how not all claim be create equal , and individual claim require differ level of evidence , neither be all religion create equal and it be rational to dislike a certain religion over another if one can be show to be more detrimental to another .
so it be irrelevant that you believe all religion play a negative role , even though i agree with you , because our priority should be focused on those which be the most detrimental .
would you honestly have us use the same resource in combating the negative effect of islam and combating the negative effect of jainism ?
i would also like you to back up your assertion that christianity , which in this country be in a weak and almost laughable form , be play a more negative role in britain 's society than islam be right now .
also , read your post you appear to be a highly arrogant , self @-@ righteous , and cocky person .
your last sentence be almost cringe worthy in its self @-@ importance .
you 're 21 .
time to get some humility and eat some humble pie , because i guarantee you 're go to be wrong on countless thing throughout your life .
if you compare a traditionally christian/buddhist/whatever country to a traditionally islamic country in term of stability , equality , safety and crime , quality of life etc , there 's a good chance the non @-@ islamic one be go to come out on top ( there would likely be exception , but as a general rule.)
that be one reason why people perceive it to be worse for society .
and i do n't say this out of hate .
i 'm aware that most individual muslims be friendly and civilised fellow .
we live in an age where celebrity be god and fame be seek after above all else .
people go crazy when see celebrity , faint when they touch them and track their each and every movement via magazine , hell there 's a subforum dedicate to them on this site !
why do we feel the need to elevate people to celebrity status and worship them ? i really do n't understand how this culture emerge and why .
must have something to do with provide people with god to worship and adore in an age in which god have be kill . by do so , i guess , many people be save from nihilism as a result of the loss of value from the death of god . thus , superstar and rockstars be put on a pedastal for people to look up to and aspire to be like . if we be live in ancient rome , for example , the superstar and rockstars would be the heroic gladiator , but the best gladiator be often think of as god in their own right . they be supposedly treat like god . ceasar himself be worship as a god by the people . the god of yestreday be the star of today . when charles atlas become famous they be say he be a god . great individual be sometimes regard as more than human by their fan . fred astair , al jolson , charlie chaplin , james dean , marlon brando , elvis , sinatra , bruce lee , bowie , morrissey , boy band like take that , lady gaga and the like .
i think its disgust that the death of a drink and drug adict get 15 seperate article on the bbc news website , and there wasnt even a mention of the british soldier kill in the same week . people need to get priority in order
i can n't recall hear of this much before the riot of late , so i wonder whether it will become a regular crime from now on .
it do n't have to occur alongside a riot , but carefully plan and limit to a close circle , it could be a very lucractive crime .
if a circle of 10 @-@ 15 target a high @-@ end retailer during a perfectly normal shop day , perhaps at a strategic location and time , i do n't really see what could stop them from loot a shop with lot of valuable merchandise within proximity of the entrance e.g. luxury clothe shop .
if we make that number 100 @/@ 200 it would be nearly impossible to stop them .
are you try to set something up or what ?
that 's different though , the riot be promote like a chain letter , be n't they , rather than a plot between a few people who all actually knew each other , and therefore could be round up fairly easily .
and surely it 's just " loot " because it be still associate with general civil unrest .
but people will see the footage of them carry off luxury goods for nothing and even pose alongside plasmas .
they 'll get idea .
apparently it be in a multicultural office . my arse it be .
even our own english people arent even allow to do anything because it will offend these immigrants...
as richard dawkins say , " so what if youre offend ?
im offend by backwards baseball cap and chew gum , doesnt mean im go to abolish it "
okay , i mean to say ban , not arrest .
id like to make this clear , its not the muslims be have a go at , but the official .
they recieved complaint ( could be muslims , we dont know ) , and the official say breastfeed be offfensive to muslims .
why do the official ssay that ?
i think its because this country be afraid of muslims - suicide bomber , poppy burner , stone people to death.... you know the story .
these official be say its offensive because they want to go on the muslims good side and not make any enemy .
islam be a bad religion .
in fact all religion be bad imo .
i think that 's a bit much .
it 's not up to muslims if she breastfeed her child her not .
tell her to fee her baby in a toilet be also ridiculous .
muslims be n't offend by breastfeed , it be just the labour councillor of the multicultural office say ' it will offend them '
people like this just end up create argument between 2 different religion @/@ community for no reason what so ever
you know what the problem be with this country ?
our school dont teach critical think .
how much of a **** do you have to be to design a curriculum without critical think on it ?
if you can ban something somebody else do based on your faith , everybody else can ban thing you do based on their faith .
if you want everybody else to use reason with you , you have to use reason with them .
how many of you support capital punishment ?
this be what i think @-
argument for :
- those who murder deserve to have the same done to them
- can be a deterrent
- justice for the victim 's family
- cheap than prison
argument against :
- the person kill could be innocent
- it 's inhumane and barbaric , the criminal may be able to be reform
- it make us just as bad as them
ultimately , i really do n't know how i stand on this issue . up until recently i be very much in favour of it . i 'd say that maybe it should be use in extreme circumstance but it 'd be difficult to know when not to execute someone .
any comment ?
to be honest i 'm for it if it 's cheaper . other than that , meh . i think be in isolation for year at a time would be worse than a quick death , although i 'm not sure .
but then , i 'm not sure if the death sentance would be cheaper , as you 'd have to have a mass of appeal and such like before hand .
i would n't support it for first time offenses , but when a criminal be give a second chance and reoffends , i 'm all for it... i mean , if the evidence be 100 % conclusive that be , which be the case most of the time now with modern technology etc
i be on a tour in ireland last week when the operator on the bus ask where everyone be from .
as it happen i be the only british person on the bus , and when ask i say that i be from ' england '.
the guide then say , ' no you 're not , you 're from the unite kingdom ' and start make a big deal out of it and i get quite embarassed .
i be actually really angry at that though because i identify far more as english than i do as british .
when we be in the pub later on , two argentinians also comment , say that they do n't think it be right for him to say that , as you would n't expect a scottish person to say that they be from the uk .
be it only the english who be n't allow this kind of pride in where they live ?
personally i find it nonsensical to be proud of something you have n't choose or done , but it 's up to you if you want to be proud where you come from .
i could n't care less really what my nationality be , it 's just letter on a passport ,
i still wonder what my identity be , a human be , a brit , a european ?
no , i prefer to call myself a overgrown monkey .
you be allow to state where you 're from .
that be n't pride . that 's just a statement of fact .
i do n't think there 's anything massively wrong to to feel a sentimental pride towards your country ,
it be human nature to feel attach to where you come from .
it be nationalism that become an issue .
his jump down your throat be his problem .
you 're from the uk and england so in my opinion which ever one you choose to identify yourself as you be correct .
you 've probably guess what this one 's about !
in the 2001 census , the question of what people 's religious affiliation be , and many people decide to put " jedi " in the hope that it would be recognised as an official religion .
it be n't . but 390,000 people decide tocall themselves jedis anyway .
i 'm wonder what people make of this .
i kinda expect more jedis to be out there , although in all honesty , i would say that i have n't actually see anyone wield a lightsaber , so that may be flaw .
i just think that seven in every thousand people be a bit small , since the campaign be well @-@ publicised , and there be no repurcussions for not tell the truth on the religion question .
so what do everyone else make of it ?
i know quite a few jews put down ''jedi'' on the census as they do n't want government record that they be jewish - that 's how hitler manage to find all the jews so easily - it be all keep carefully on detailed and accurate note .
it can be argue that it be none of the government 's concern as to where each jew/muslim/sikh/christian etc. lives..
how would that affect gdp or the state of the economy ?
on the other hand it can be say that they should know who practice what as they run the country and can thus make law accord the proportionate number of each faith etc.
- as a jew and have experience anti @-@ semtism myself ( as many jews have and do ) i would sway towards the former view in term of safety , but i can understand why people would disagree with this and choose the latter .
earlier this month the result from the 2011 british social attitude survey be publish by the government .
the main find , as mention in the title , be that for the first time a full 50 % of british people no long associate themselves with any religion , and over half of the people that do affiliate with a religion never attend religious service or meeting , with only 14 % attend such event on a weekly basis .
it 's die . good .
i do n't really care either way , to be honest .
all this really prove be that the question on the census need reword .
nice to see that those lack a religion be now a majority , although thankfully uk christians tend to be very reserve and moderate unlike their us counterpart .
though undoubtedly many of the response on this thread will still use the 2001 census as a reliable source for religious demographics despite the fact it 's ten year old .
good .
will be interesting to compare this to the census data when it 's release .
i be regain my faith in humanity .
america next .
america be probably a lost cause , but i 'm please to see we 're go scandinavian .
this be n't intrinsically an anti @-@ islam thread .
nor be i say that other religion do n't have follower that do thing that be similar and worse .
today that 's not my focus .
million of lamb be ritually kill a short time ago .
many muslims make the claim that it be do in a way that be painless .
however , i 'm unsure of what be really go on .
children be see to be show disrespect and a lack of care .
adult the same .
even if you claim that animal and human simply be n't equal , it do not justify harm them .
it would be like claim i be above someone else therefore i can do what i want to them .
it do n't make any sense .
this video show the lamb , which appear to be in a great deal of pain , be kill .
my question be , how be that peaceful ?
or justify ?
in this day and age in the western world it have become increasingly easy to be a vegan .
so why would you put animal intentionally through unnecessary pain and suffer ?
graphic video in spoiler :
2 minute in you see a lamb kill .
6.44 what look like salt be put over where the wound will be . will this not worsen the pain ?
during the hajj , muslims remember and commemorate the trial and triumph of the prophet abraham ( as ) .
the meat from the sacrifice of eid al @-@ adha be mostly give away to others although there be no limit to what may be eat or give in charity or use to fee the poor or the rich or even if one want to give it away cook or uncooked .
generally though , it be prefer that you give most of it in charity .
the method of slaughter be similar to the one used throughout the whole world , by muslims and non @-@ muslims .
there be probably many variant though but consider one method " worse " than another be subjective .
the most important difference though be that in islam , you be obligate to put the animal under as little pain as possible and to treat it humanely ( during the slaughter and every instant of it 's live before it ) .
anyone who say halal ritual do not cause pain be a liar .
i have see an animal throat slit and it survive and be in a lot of pain .
ironically it be a pig that be be slaughter .
i be in cyprus and they slit its throat .
before any muslim say " it be n't do properly , " do n't talk that crap .
the cut be so deep i be surprise it be n't fully decapitate .
however the pig squeal in agony and be still run until it bleed out .
i 'm sorry but its all a load of crap " halal doesnt cause pain "
if you have a problem with the slaughter of animal , you should be vegetarian and disapprove of all slaughter , which i assume you be .
why this have anything to do with islam and a festival where lamb be slaughter for the poor in memory of ibrahim 's ( abraham 's ) loyalty to god i do not see .
oh and btw , a few year ago i be in a town near my home city in india with my family for qurbani - and literally the people there be starve and malnourished beyond belief .
to such people , the pain of an animal be the last thing on their mind .
i only mention because it be so easy to view thing from a western first world perspective , which be why we also criticise chinese fur farm where fur be strip from animal when they be alive cause unbelievable pain for incredibly long extended period , but to a chinese family in the remote rural region , it be their only source of bread and butter - and trust me , these people who really do not know whether they will get another meal ( unlike the gluttony we engage in 24 @/@ 7 since birth here in the west ) think very differently from us - and justifiably so .
the recent case of the christian pastor in iran have give me cause to ponder the question in the thread title .
here we have a man who know that his life be in great peril if he refuse to recant his christian faith , yet that be exactly what he do .
it go without say that his bravery be truly commendable .
his possible martyrdom parallel that of the apostle who evangelised in the knowledge that what they be do would likely get them kill .
i often wonder if i would be so brave if i be in their shoe
i love god more than anything , but it 's impossible to imagine what kind of pressure the pastor in iran be under .
would you sacrifice yourself in defence of your faith ?
yes , without doubt , yes i will sacrifice myself in defence of my faith .
god do sacrifice himself for us , so i think it 's sensible for us to sacrifice ourselves for our religion .
even if i be religious i doubt i would ever die for my religion .
whats the point ?
do you think it get you an automatic ticket to heaven ?
be it go to change the mind of the one who kill you ?
what about your family and friend ?
if someone hold a gun to your head and demmands you recant , just f***ing do it ! !
it doesnt mean anything , god isnt go to deny you access to heaven because you make a perfectly rational decision under intense pressure
i 've be watch some of his video and i definitely think he have a right to criticize religion if he want to .
but i find a lot of the time he make such sweeping statement and sometimes unnecessary insult that annoy me .
what do you think of him and his video ?
he 's a bit aggressive , rave and rant a lot , and mix up a lot of different political stance into one bundle when many be in no way relate , but beyond that....
yeah , guy speak a lot of truth .
everytime when i watch him , i think to myself " okay , we get it .
you hate muslims .
and your point is..?".
just spot the thread about the patterson film , and look over at it they 're seem to be some people claim to not only believe in bigfoot but claim to have see one , not im not sure if this be sarcasm , but what the hell....
anyone see a real life sasquatch ?
i 've see an actual photograph of an actual person in an actual bigfoot costume .
do that count ?
for any who be n't already aware huntster believe he come upon a sasquatch trackway and i while camp with friend on vancouver island several year ago find two set of track and have a close range audio encounter with what at the time i attributed to sasquatch( es @- at the time i think there be an adult and juvenile ) but now i discount the event as inconclusive and likely mistaken identity give the spurious nature of bf evidence .
however , i still fel pretty confident i could rule out hoax because of the remoteness of the area .
but hey , you never know...
i actually surf in after a year because i want to hear the jref side on this issue . no one appear to have post about this yet .
apparently , the two folk that die pay nearly 10,000 dollar to attend the new age sweat lead by two time oprah guest .
james arthur ray - a non @-@ native american , lead over 60 people into the sweat ' lodge '.
20 people become ill , and one more be still in critical condition tonight .
i just read about this story .
it 's a tragedy , and i also find it reveal that the new age guru in question , mr. ray , have since leave the state of arizona .
from what i understand , it sound like ray do n't know what the hell he be do , because he put entirely too many people in entirely too small a space .
in addition , they cover the lodge with material that do n't allow for decent air flow .
put all of that together , and you have a situation ripe for asphyxiation .
apparently they be still want to question the guy .
they say he be uncooperative .
i do n't know much about the law on this but would n't it be negligent homicide or something ?
this would be an interesting story to keep up with .
i have be search for this story to no avail .
a few week ago me and a few friend watch a tv show on discovery ( their house not mine ! ) where a guy claim to have recover from a coma with a newfound ability...
he can play the piano like an expert .
he say he can n't write music , but he see musical note in his mind and he can " miraculously " play them seemingly perfect , or close to it .
he claim to have no musical train and have never play an instrument in his life .
my b.s. meter go off , of course .
do anyone here have more information about this guy ?
i can n't remember his name...i think he be in the u.s.
i can n't find anything on the web or here at jref .
for musician : i wonder how he would handle key signature since he say the note just fly by in his mind .
are they notate as sharp or flat ?
or be he stick in c major forever ?
my off the cuff guess be that he play the piano before the coma .
perhaps he be a fail musician and see an opportunity to get into the limelight .
i would think people in his life would know that he could play previously , but as we all know , believer won't care , or simply claim that these people be lie .
the ability to play the piano and other instrument to a high level not only involve technical ability but also physical train ( remember the first time you try to spin note on a guitar or piano ? )
how be it possible he wake with all his piano play muscle fully develop ?
well in the case of the guy sack write about , it be more a matter of wake up to a newfound passion for the piano , not that he wake a fully develop piano player .
he claim to have be a guy who listen to rock music before the accident , but afterward could n't get enough of piano music , start to sit down at a piano to play , and then more and more often , and then he be hear music in his head , and it just become an obsession .
so nothing really mystical about it . the man himself seem to put a spiritual spin on it , but it make sense all the same without it .
i 'd say it 's not impossible .
he seem to be play by ear .
his music be unstructured ; it sound like he 's just play whatever come into his head .
he 's not play classical work like mozart .
also , i 'd say he 's self @-@ teach at the very least .
watch his hand .
he do n't hold them in the typical position that most piano player be teach .
he look like he 's just stab at the next note he want to play .
it have be note that there have be a lot of thread create on the topic of global warm .
a great number of these topic rapidly descend into bicker and other rule violation .
although one of the biggest thread be put on moderate status , it seem that many of the other thread have spring up in order to avoid moderate status .
that thread have now be close .
since many of the thread cover the same or similar ground , we 've decide to keep only this thread for general global warm discussion , which will be moderate .
unless the topic be very different from the " general " discussion , new thread and post about global warm will be move to that thread if they satisfy the membership agreement .
failure to confine general discussion to this moderate thread or start other thread for general discussion will be treat as rule 6 violation and subject to a series of escalate penalty just like any other membership violation .
we hope this will encourage civility in the discussion of global warm .
we realize this topic inspire strong emotion , but please contain your emotion to those form which be permissible under the membership agreement .
i do n't know if you guy have follow potholer54 's channel on youtube , but his series of delightfully devastate and wither video on climate science and creationism be something to behold .
the latest in the series look at the " scientist " that represent the denialist side in the climate " debate "
i 'm aware of realclimate.org , have read a few article and what not over the last few month .
the response be of course tongue and cheek , a commentary on the nonsense that you can n't have a meaningful discussion without hot link .
hoepfully this new thread will promote just such discussion .
i do n't see how , short of turn to nuclear entirely , how we can reduce co2 level without sequester and ge .
not only that , but if you believe the current model to be accurate , we need to reduce the effect of co2 now .
so this could have be in the science , music , or current event forum and if any mod should choose to move it , that will be fine with me .
i 'm watch the grammys and they 've put on a tribute to glenn campbell include campbell sing rhinestone cowboy .
and in the tribute they announce he have alzheimer 's .
it amaze me that people be be diagnose when they still have enough think capacity to discuss their fate .
be rich , i hope he get to try the new treatment recently successfully use on mice .
i would .
it 's a drug currently approve for chemotherapy in human .
this will be remarkable if it pan out .
so why do i post this and make it about glenn campbell instead of just about the science ?
i do n't know .
it just strike me hear the announcement campbell have alzheimer 's at the same time he be still well enough to appear on stage at the grammy 's .
it 's weird .
and the discovery of a treatment that be a drug already approve for use in human should make a bit different of a pathway for research .
if you be wealthy or simply have access to the drug , and have alzheimer 's would you use it immediately instead of wait for conclusive study ?
i have this discussion with linda ( fls ) in the past and i really wish she have n't leave the forum because i 'd like to use this example to revisit the discussion .
i can n't speak for her but i get the impression she would wait for the research to be more conclusive .
i use the criteria : if it be not harmful and there be some evidence it might work , and if there be no better alternative , i think it be worth try .
in this case it be the potential benefit and lack of any alternative treatment and the fact alzheimer 's be such a devastate terminal disease that it outweigh the fact the research be premature .
what say the rest of you ?
i 'd do it in a heartbeat .
our brain be who we be , and without memory we be just animal .
you risk almost nothing , to gain everything .
my feel be that when i grow old enough that i 've " have a good run , " why not donate my body to science before i die ?
if i have some disease that will kill me in a few month or year anyway , then , by all mean , experiment on me with some new drug that have potential .
and if i have some issue that won't kill me for awhile , well , what the hell if the new drug cause some side effect ?
i can always stop take it .
either way , there be some chance that i 'll help people younger than i be .
and once i die , then take my body and do whatever be useful with it .
i do n't need it anymore .
i be my mind .
at age 72 , with the possibility of alzheimer 's loom in my future , i would take any supplement or drug -- experimental or otherwise -- that may prevent or delay this dread condition .
obviously i would avoid anything demonstrably and seriously harmful .
many conjecture like nsaids , simvastatin , fish oil have come and gone .
i have and will continue to try them all until they be proven ineffective or seriously harmful .
precious little news on development .
last i see russian scientist be say that they may have reach the surface .
i be frankly about as interested in this as be humanly possible .
though i expect that little will be find outside of micro @-@ organism , i have hope that there will be discovery similar to those around the black smoker .
my kid be hope for cthulhu .
they may have to wait until after xmas .
a bit of an anticlimax consider the conversation we have on the subject last year ,
much more grip than this thread mate !
the huge interconnected lake about two mile below antarctic ice can n't be touch because they must be under enormous pressure .
i would think that to drill into them would cause a collapse of hundred of mile of ice , erupt water , flood and wipe out area the size of victoria ?
as be usual at jref , much hilarity and education then ensued...
anxiety and inattention over tokyo 's next big one
it point out that a magnitude 7 earthquake be actually 1000 time smaller in term of energy release that the magnitude 9.0 earthquake that cause the tsunami last year .
however , the great kanto earthquake of 1923 which kill over 100,000 be a 7.9 .
and , i 'm pretty sure they do n't mean that this earthquake will be exactly magnitude 7 .
it could be bigger .
still , i think that tokyo be more earthquake @-@ resistant today than it be in 1923 .
so , i guess i 'll take my chance .
take your chance ? !
what do you live in tokyo ?
curious...do other earthquake agency agree with the data from tokyo ?
i would like to know what scale they 're use , because different seismic scale can result in enormously different result .
a perfect example be the two largest christchurch earthquake .
the first be m7+ but do only minor damage and cause no fatality due to a low mercalli intensity read ( actual measure of intensity of shake in a particular place ) .
the second m6.3 quake register at x ( intense ) and higher on the mercalli intensity scale and have the highest peak ground acceleration ever record .
many seismologist have say that the quake would have completely flatten almost any city in the world .
in term of energy release , the deadly christchurch quake be not particularly big , but in term of shake intensity it be one of the most destructive quake ever record .
japan 's " shindo " scale be like the mercalli intensity scale , but do n't have anywhere near as many division .
the highest category be 7 which seem to equate with viii on the mercalli scale ( it go up to xii ) .
this basically mean a scale 7 quake could be anything from a decently size but not overly destructive quake right up to a city @-@ leveling event .
i hear this term for a single world currency .
why be it that cts seem to think this be a threat ?
we can n't even get 2.5 political party to agree on fundamental economic principle .
there 's no reason to believe that we could get the us , mexico and canada to ever agree on a common currency .
plus , the euro zone be show strain around the edge , so now would be a very bad time to try .
so why do you guy think the us invade iraq and afghanistan ?
do you think our leader really think iraq have wmd ?
and do you think they actually care ?
who benefit from the war ?
which industry , which money @/@ power interest , which lobby group , etc ?
why be the us posture so strongly against iran ?
are they really concern about wmds ?
what would iran do with wmds that would scare the us so much ?
iran take great control and spread rebellion against us ?
regional arm race ?
iran use the bomb ?
america have be toying with the idea of " revisiting " iraq ever since the first war end , particularly in 1998 , when saddam first start get coy with the inspector .
it do n't get much traction then because america be , at the time , experience a resurgance of isolation after the end of the cold war .
the issue be the same then , but bush find the post @-@ 9 @/@ 11 america a bit more ameniable to the idea of war .
oil , wmds , al queda , these be all simply mcguffins .
the real reason be that saddam be a petty dictator who weilded an inordinate amount of influence and be continually give the impression that he be up to something .
whether he actually be or not be n't the point .
be careful of special interest group hijack the message .
that 's what happen to the tea party lead them to be co @-@ opted into the fox news gop .
even if people show up who you agree with on some political issue , ask yourselves if that issue be actually relate to what the protest be about .
there will be , and probably already be , many faction who want nothing more than to turn the entire movement into a dnc fundraiser .
suddenly it will be about collective bargain for teacher or something else that do n't involve a corporation at all , let alone wall street .
the partisan on both side will try and expand their trench such that your movement fall into them .
keep an eye out , do n't be the next tea party .
what identity ?
it 's a collection of every wingnut cause out there , from ron paultards to communist to anarchist to anti @-@ israel to people who like to dress as zombie .
they want more government , less government , more immigration , protectionism , etc etc.
they protest corporation even as they organize on facebook and twitter and youtube use laptop computer and smart phone , all fruit of corporation .
they rail against oil company while power generator with gasoline .
they want to end capitalism , while also get better pay .
what entity will pay them absent capitalism i have no idea .
kid throw a temper tantrum , basically .
they interview some of them on npr the other day .
one guy admit they do n't have a cohesive message and he be n't sure if they could have one consider the disparate group that be there .
he also acknowledge the irony of use large corporation like verizon to get the message out and use the mcdonalds to go to the bathroom .
the new york time print an opinion piece by a mr eric x. lee which assert china 's political system be superior to americas .
i do n't know if they though they be be edgy , but that 's a pretty stupid thing to print .
what next ?
islamic attitude to women superior to the west 's ?
you think people should only print that which toe the party line ?
why be it a " stupid thing to print " - opinion piece as far as i know be mean to be opinion and it may surprise some folk but not everyone hold the same opinion as they do .
given that news paper often print opinion piece to raise interest in their title it seem that it be far from be a pretty stupid thing to print as we be talk about the newspaper...
yeah , your thread title rather give a mislead opinion about the nyt virus .
i 'm sure that be a complete accident of course .
i hear all sort of perspective on marriage . those who think monogamy be the proper standard , those who think monogamy be a tool use to oppress women , those who think that polygamy be terrible , those who think that polygamy be natural , etc.
but virtually ever culture in the world have some form of marriage...a concept in which a life @-@ long union be idealize , where there be formal ceremony to ' sanctify ' a man and a woman ( or multiple thereof ) . culture where , from childhood , children be raise and teach these ideal to the point where most of us think it be a natural part of human nature .
the form of marriage may differ from culture to culture , but it be consistent throughout our culture .
that be , except for at least one very unique culture , the mosuo , a chinese minority group who live in the himalayan mountain , close to the border with tibet .
two year ago , i establish a non @-@ profit organization to work with the mosuo , focusing on a variety of aspect ( education , development , etc.), but also on promote awareness of their culture , and to try to preserve it .
in the mosuo culture , there be no marriage .
no marriage ceremony exist .
there be no expectation whatsoever of life @-@ time bond or pairings .
children be raise not only without an expectation of spend their life with that one special person , but they often do n't even know ( or care ) who their biological father be .
in the mosuo culture , men and women can change and choose partner as they please .
monogamy be not consider special or even particularly desirable .
the mosuo live in large extended family , with many generation ( grandparent , parent , children , grandchildren , etc.) all live together in the same house .
men sleep in communal sleep room ( they do n't have private bedroom ) ; only the women have the luxury of a private bedroom .
thus , women tend to the the one in control of relationship .
traditionally , a mosuo woman will invite a man to spend the night with her .
the man will come to her home at night , sneak in through her window ( it be also a part of the mosuo culture that , while everyone know this be happen , it should be do in a manner that be not obvious ) , spend the night , and then leave early the next morning before everyone wake up .
thus the term " walk marriage "...because the men must walk to and from their assign rendevous each night .
the mosuo walk marriage be generally the most interesting -- and misunderstood -- aspect of mosuo culture .
people be always fascinate by it , but misunderstanding and misperceptions abound .
one of the most common misperceptions be that the mosuo be very promiscuous , change partner all the time .
that be patently not true ; in fact , many mosuo pair will last for year , and even decade .
there be no social stigma if someone do change partner often , but it be more common for the mosuo to engage in what have be describe as " serial monogamy "...that be , they do n't stick with one partner for their whole life , but each pair will tend to last for an extended period , and they won't generally have multiple partner while in a relationship .
however , there be fascinate and very unique aspect of these walk marriage .
first , even among couple who be together for months/years/decades , they generally will never actually live together , or share property .
the man will continue to live in his family 's home , and his responsibility be to that family ; while the woman will continue to live her her home , and be responsible to her family .
the man will visit her at night , but the rest of the time they generally live separate life .
and what if they have a baby ? in general , father have little or no responsibility for children produce from such union ;
the baby will be raise in the mother 's home , and be a part of her family , not the father 's .
however , that do not mean that the men have no responsibility...it be just that the focus of that responsibility be shift .
in most culture , a man will be responsible to care for his own children ;
in mosuo culture , a man be responsible to care for the children of his sisters/nieces/aunts/etc . so mosuo men still have full parenting responsibilities...perhaps even moreso , since they may end up share responsibility for the children of many family member .
now , in some case , mosuo men do want to be involve in their own childrens ' upbringing .
if that be the case , after the child be born , the father will go to the mother 's home , and present the family matriarch with gift , ask to be accept as the father .
if the matriarch accept him , he be then an ' honorary member ' of the family , and have the right to visit and @/@ or stay there like any other family member , and to help raise the child .
however , this be not a frequent practice .
although this sound very strange at first , it actually provide remarkable stability for the children .
first , they be not raise by just one parent ; everyone in the family share in parental duty , so the child really end up have multiple father and mother figure .
furthermore , if the mother and father end their relationship , there be virtually no impact or stress for the child .
there 's no fight over split property , because they never share property .
there 's no fight over custody of the child , because the child never belong to the father to begin with .
the mother 's relationship with different men may change , but it have little or no effect on the children .
one more thing i 'd like to point out . while this system actually work very effectively for the mosuo , it work only in a situation where there be a large extend family to provide support .
for those mosuo men and women who leave home to live @/@ work on their own in other city , they almost always choose more traditional marriage .
after all , care for a baby without its father when you have 20 other people in your home to help you be one thing ;
care for a baby without its father when you live by yourself be another matter entirely .
for more information about the mosuo , their culture , and our work with them , you can check out our organization 's website . and i welcome question and comment about this , or other aspect of mosuo culture .
while their way of life hold no particular allure to me ( my job consists of sit , write on paper and think about thing , i be allergic to horse , my great joy be my western traditional family of my wife and 2 daughter ) i applaud your effort to provide as unobtrusive assistance to these people as possible .
diversity of culture and think be a good thing , and i like your organization emphasis on put them in control .
i would suggest that you do n't worry about people who suggest that you try to protect them somehow from the outside world .
if the mosuo do n't want you or your organization 's help , i be sure they be quite capable of tell you to get lose .
when you say " we " be do this , who be " we "?
in particular , have you hook up with the various group like the lsa and the endanger language foundation ?
there 's a lot -- well , by linguistics standard , a lot -- of money float around for do exactly this , and it sound like mosuo be one language that might be saveable if you can bring it to the attention of the appropriate professional .
so depending upon who the linguist you be bring in are , it may be possible @/@ practical to get some real heavyweight to come in for their support....
wolfman , sound like you 're do some amaze work !
the mosuo sound like a fascinate people .
matrilineal system be indeed rather rare .
i think there use to be ( ) some in polynesia .
i do n't know if property be own by female but it be transfer through the female line ( a man 's heir would be his sister 's children ) .
i think some of the native american tribe in the u.s. plain be also matrilineal .
very interesting . what this show , i think , be that while there be no marriage , there be also no illegitimacy -- that be , most children ( a ) know who their father be ( and the father do not deny it , even if they have no role in care for them ) and ( b ) have two male and female adult ( mother and her brother ) take care of them .
also , it 's easy to see why this social arrangement will discourage promiscuity .
in general , most men will be responsible for raise , roughly , the same number of children as they have , even if they do n't raise their own children .
however , if you be a man who have too many partner -- or , more important , too many children -- you be probably see as a freeloader : someone who make society take care of their many children while only care for a few of society 's children in return .
am i correct here ?
you 're the expert , i 'm just make an educated(?) guess .
you have to wonder why this be not big news and her hearing kinda fade out of the spotlight...
could it be that there be this long drawn out leak that be go to end the world in the gulf , that this administration seem hell bent on let continue ? lol
i be sure their genitalia will make a lot of difference when ti come time to make a decision...
i do n't remember much balleyhoo when the second black be elevate to the bench but then......
i 've enable multiple choice for this poll because i 'd like you to select which 3 candidate will finish in the top 3 in new hampshire .
the new hampshire primary be just 5 day away .
in the average of the last 4 poll there it look like this :
romney 40 %
paul 19 %
gingrich 11 %
huntsman 10 %
santorum 4 %
perry 2 %
in two of the more recent poll , between 35 @-@ 40 % of nh voter say they be either " likely to change their mind " or " undecided/uncommitted ".
what be your vote prediction for next tuesday ?
i 'm gonna ramble a bit and then reveal mine .
the consensus appear to be that mitt romney need a big win in nh in order to propel him in sc since his iowa result be almost to the vote the same total as 2008 .
no new support for mitt .
in ' 08 , mitt finish 2 nd to mccain in nh and get 32 % of the vote .
how much of that 40 % right now be hardcore romney support ?
inexplicably , he avoid an onslaught of attack over the last few week as the focus turn on newt , but now one of the big question become about what republican really think about the idea of mitt clean up in nh and quite possibly everywhere else , too .
i think nh be a test of how comfortable or not republican be with mitt as the presumptive front @-@ runner .
i think that like iowa , he 'll hold on to the support in nh he get last time .
so he 'll come down to earth a little bit but won't totally implode there .
everybody need to see the iowa speech .
newt 's be fiery and disgruntle .
he 's so much more interesting when he 's an attack dog and he be position himself now as want to be the fullback to rick santorum ; if he 's go down , he want to take romney with him , and in the meantime that 'll let santorum have a positive week and float above the fray .
rick santorum be leave evangelical country and go into a 60 % catholic state .
between hard right establishment catholics there and that close to 40 % undecided number , santorum should be able to get into double digit .
but how high do he go ?
i think if mitt come down to the low 30 's and it appear that santorum keep come up and can crack 25 % again , it 'll be another soft @-@ boil mitt non @-@ win win .
if newt and santorum now represent the more traditional gop establishment and be fight over that share in nh , ron paul and john huntsman be share the independent vote .
will huntsman be nh 's santorum ?
ron paul appear ready to keep cruise around 20 % and another top 3 finish .
rick perry be totally insignificant and should have quit along with michele bachmann .
romney 's ahead by an average of 21 % .
that 's go to come down to earth , but how much , and how much before it 's perceive that he 's fall and somebody else be rise ?
i think the threshold be that he need to win by 10 % in order to gain any kind of traction as the front @-@ runner .
in iowa , my prediction ( actual result in parenthesis ) be pretty close :
santorum 27 % ( 25 )
romney 26 % ( 25 )
paul 22 % ( 22 )
gingrich 9 % ( 13 )
perry 8 % ( 10 )
bachmann 5 % ( 5 )
that be with a day or so out .
this be more of a crapshoot at this point but here go .
romney 32 %
santorum 25 %
paul 21 %
huntsman 11 %
perry 1 %
i 'm think it 's go to be romney and paul with a considerable lead , and gingrich a distant third .
i would be distinctly and pleasantly surprise if huntsman make the top three and absolutely tickle pink if he win , but i do n't see it happen .
huntsman 's go to have to get some notice at the debate to finish in the top 3 .
if the others be attack themselves like children , than maybe he can come up the middle and seem like the adult in the room and then nh will make a statement by elevate him to the anti @-@ romney surge candidate in that state .
i feel like it 's go to be tough for him to break out .
you be probably right , romney and paul for sure , but once the light shine on santorum , the nh voter be n't go to like what they see .
i still see three vote block , romney , paul and someone else .
huntsman have n't have a turn be someone else yet , and he 's more appeal to nh voter than santorum .
romney by a big number , because he life in nh in a palatial home on lake winnipesaukee , and he 's be work on this primary for 5 year .
paul because he 'll draw a lot of independent voter , and i think gingrich be fade along with perry .
this be all go down to how much the anti @-@ romney vote start to close the divide .
in the suffolk poll for wednesday , it be romney 43 % and santorum 6 % .
today it 's a two @-@ day total now of 41 % to 8 % .
from a 37 point gap to a 33 point gap . now , if it 's 37 point after one day , but the two @-@ day total be 33 , that mean the second @-@ day stand alone would be 39 to 10 , a 29 point gap .
meanwhile , huntsman be down in the two @-@ day total back to single digit .
santorum 's small bump so far have cost newt the most .
watch for him to hit the double digit in the next couple poll .
ron paul be sail with his strong 20 % .
i think the video below from a charlie chaplin movie be one of the best piece that could be superimpose and run as a ron paul ad .
i would love to see something like this run on national television .
it 's a preach to the choir ad .
it have no place on television because it do n't speak to the undecideds .
near the end you could replace the " ron paul " chant with any other candidate and it would have the same effect .
there 's nothing in it that speak of paul 's view or intend policy .
lastly , negative ad be far more effective than positive one .
1940. and still be relevent today .
the ideal chaplin espouse here , will never die , and only get push back , to arise again .
humanity can indeed be thankful for that , that we only go through stage of insanity , and have the chance of overcome that .
this should be an ad for obama .
but he would have to cut his tie to the greedy .
his tie to the one behind the curtain , call the shot .
yet this thread be about paul , so never mind .
i keep hear ton of people run off at the mouth about how dangerous ron paul 's foreign policy be and how they be out of touch with the real world .
the problem be that all the people who would be consider expert , and even israel itself ( in regard to iran ) , agree with paul .
i 've be on two deployment and my job be an arabic linguist of 10 year .
i 'm fairly knowledgeable about how the culture work in that part of the world , as be many of the expert .
our interference do , indeed , cause more problem for us than what we be try to stop .
we support the rebel in egypt and it 's now be take over by radical .
who know where libya be go to end up .
anyways , be all the expert kooky as well ?
i find that the judge be actually one of a few mainstream conservative that have a shred of honesty and actually understand what conservatism be .
if someone have only bomb the reactor in israel and south africa , while the us and other country have prosecute and imprison all the traitor who leak nuclear weapon information and give the necessary technology to them...
the us be largely directly to blame for the proliferation of nuclear weapon through its " atom for peace " program .
but back on topic , if ron paul be " kooky " then so be most other politician in any country on the planet .
and that be certainly true with most of our suppose ally .
911 be blowback from us stick our nose in business that be not our business .
with that say , i still want to kill anyone who be responsible in the plan , or anyone who shield these people .
no one in the right mind would think the attacker just do it for shit and giggle .
they think they have valid reason to attack us . and perhaps they do .
america be not perfect .
they be hope to wind us gravely by attack our financial system . a weak link in our chain .
they should have just save those life , because we allow bank to fuck our system up greater than aq could have ever do .
leave it up to us , to be our worst enemy .
i think that a lot of people automatically assume that anyone who say our foreign policy be why they be angry at us be also justify their response .
it be understandable they be upset , but neither ron paul nor anyone else who be support him be say their response be in any way justify .
indiscriminately targeting women and children be cowardly and people who do that should be capture or kill .
i really be tire of hear that they hate us because we be free or because of our belief .
it would be like you build a shack in my backyard and every now and then one of my dog go miss , then when i get upset that it be there you say i be mad because you have bacon burger fridays in your own house back on your property and i hate bacon ( which be clearly only a hypothetical as i love bacon ) .
why ? because expert do n't agree with him on his kooky policy stand , which be manifold :
*denounces the civil right act because it infringe the free @-@ market right of a monolithic white establishment to immiserate black ;
*dabbles in gold buggery and advocate the elimination of the federal reserve , apparently because the global economy work so well back in the era before central bank ( that 's call sarcasm ) ;
*suggests that the border fence be be build to keep americans from leave the country ;
*claims that social security and medicare be unconstitutional and should be dismantle ;
*mounts repeat warning that hyperinflation be right around the corner ( tsquare , take a bow ) ;
*insists that global warm be a gigantic hoax ( yes , rush limbaugh know more about global climate science than nasa ;
*hinted that maybe the cia help to coordinate the 9 @/@ 11 attack ;
*opposes government @-@ sponsor flu shot ;
*and allege that the un want to confiscate our gun .
( list adapt from th be blog )
and this list do n't even get into all the racism and homophobia of his newsletter , which use his name , be sign by him and which raise thousand of dollar which he be happy to pocket but have be disavow by him now that they be a liability .
note that none of this list mention our relation with iran .
there 's lot of kookiness without have to go there .
are you a communist ?
my friend and i walk into a pizza shop .
it be $ 3 a slice .
they have a special , a 12 @-@ slice for $ 10 .
if we both get two slice each , that would make it 4 slice at a total of $ 12 .
we be assure the slice in the 12 @-@ slice be the same size , so we get that .
we each pitch in $ 5 each ( which can n't even buy you two slice oddly enough ) and get 6 slice each , which we 've just polish off in fairly record time .
we pool our resource and struck the better deal for the both of us , and we actually make a joke about proud and full communist .
now we 're roll a joint from a bag of wee we each pitch in on in order to save money as well .
got our usual amount of wee each , but each pay $ 5 less because one of us do the transaction and buy twice as much as usual for the individual .
if these thing make me a communist , than i 'll drink to that , but i just call it better business sense mostly .
real communism would be they could go get a pizza without pay at all , and the pizza guy could come by their auto @-@ part place to pick up a distributor cap without pay at all .
real communism only exist in israel 's kibbutz though .
the problem you be have jason marcel be that it be impossible for many people , and especially people in america , to conceive of cooperation and sacrifice without force behind it .
they be so lock into their little me @-@ centric universe that they can n't see cooperate with someone else unless someone make them .
seriously , i think the problem here be that a lot of people in the u.s. , conservative especially , when they hear the word " communism " think of the soviet union .
not only be the soviet union not communist , it do n't even pretend to be .
the word refers in marxist theory only to the end stage of social progress , what a socialist state and economy evolve into : a stateless utopia in which everything be share equally .
when communism be reach , socialism be no more , because socialism presume the existence of the state , and under communism there be no state .
the motto under socialism be " from each accord to his ability , to each accord to his work." under communism , it 's the more @-@ familiar , " from each accord to his ability , to each accord to his need ."
the soviet union be socialist .
it never pretend to be communist , even though it be govern by something call the communist party .
communism be what they be in theory evolve towards , but certainly not what they already have .
communism be not a coercive system ; it 's the exact opposite .
neither the private coercion of capitalism , nor the state coercion of socialism be find in a communist society .
if it be possible to have a communist society , it would be a wonderful thing .
edit : i answer " no " to the poll , because although communism be a beautiful dream , i consider it no more than that .
what do you guy think about a ron paul run for president in 2012 .
though he 's kind of old , he be still sharp and incredibly intelligent - and consistent .
his vote record be very consistent and he do n't vote for any legislation that be n't expressly allow by the constitution .
given this , the grassroots support he have in 2008 , and the fact that his message be very closely align with that of the tea party movement , do think he could head either a tea party ( or more likely ) gop ticket .
i really think give paul 's astoundingly consistent message and vote record ( and reputation ) that he could mount a serious challenge to obama . w
hat do you guy think ?
the role of leader of the free world be not well fill by an isolationist .
paul/palin , have a nice ring to it .
once again the republican solution be a geriatric nut , only this time it 's a relgious fanatic instead of senile warmonger .
i wonder , will hillary be too old in 2016?
hillary won't be " too old " in 2016 , but she will still be too hillary .
habemus papademos !
finally after day of intense political infight in athens the new prime minister seem to be the biggest favourite for the job : lucas papademos .
he be an ex @-@ ecb vice president .
but foremost he be not a career politician as his profession be actually an academic one , partly in the us where he also study .
papademos seem to be well respect in the eu but also within greece , as far as a greek prime minister could be respect in a country like greece where be politician has a worse reputation than be a bank robber .
i be positively surprise about this choice .
at least someone take over who have an understand of economics in quite some detail and be not from the old political class .
i do n't think one could have hope for anything better than that .
on another note . there be rumors that mario monti could become the next prime minister of italy .
monti , also dub " super mario ", be a former eu commissioner and will still ring some bell for example in redmond , simply because it be him who do not shy away from take a fight with an extreme heavyweight like microsoft over anti @-@ trust issue .
( same go for company like vw etc ) .
if both news would be true , this would make the dark horizon look a little less dark indeed .
these two men would be the best choice for their respective country in time like these in my humble opinion .
they know economics , have a reputation of be not involve in corruption , dare to do what they believe have to be do and be convince europeans .
the ex head of the ecb take over at the helm of the world 's most financially trouble country and you be " positively " surpised ?
personally i be hope for eva kaili , but obviously for different reason .
he be n't the head of the ecb but one of the vice president , ie in the govern council of the ecb . for all the shortcoming of the euro , i can n't see how the ecb have do a bad job .
he seem to be a really clever guy , understand economics like few prime minister in the world probably , as he teach it in harvard i think .
eva kaili would have be a great choice .
well at least it would have make the newspaper look more interesting...
well , she 's not the most attractive woman in the world but for a politician there be n't many hot out there...
she must get lose in my post , what with the other women and all .
i think i have a thing for blonde women...
anyhow , so see as i can find myself talk positively about a socialist like this , be n't it your turn to talk about palin like this in thread about the tea party ?
btw , i think give her experience in journalism and tv media , she would have do a good job relay the message of what the essential need of bailout measure be , to the greek people .
she also be very respectful in her final day of dissent in the previous coallition , and do n't even call for him to resign .
that i can respect .
it 's a very good idea to have a former ecb man in the job .
we have too many bureaucrat and lawyer and career politician in charge of economic matter .
it be good to see someone with economic experience .
i think i 'm one of those who like watch the superbowl for all the new ad .
ferris bueller be alright and seinfeld be pretty funny , but clint eastwood 's ad for chrysler make them the winner two year in a row after eminem 's wicked ad for them last year .
i believe eastwood be speak from the heart , that 's why i think it 's such an amaze and curious ad since it look and feel so much like the kind of thing the obama campaign would find favorable to them .
clint eastwood be a lifelong moderate conservative .
fiscal conservative , social libertarian .
vote for nixon twice because the man promise to end the war .
his first vote be for eisenhower .
he endorse john mccain last time out .
have n't endorse anyone in that field yet , but say he like ron paul .
he say he would n't call himself a hardcore conservative or an extreme lefty .
from the stuff he be for and against in recent year , it paint a picture of the kind of voter that will decide the election , and i think eastwood taps into that feel of want to make a comeback happen .
there 's something to be gain by this guy 's performance , a man of rugged self @-@ reliance who also take the time to acknowledge in the ad that " we all pull together ", his tip of that of course to the bailouts which he be supportive of .
the candidate who will win the election be the one who can tap into that emotion too .
great ad .
its half time in america and beer cost more because alcohol tax increase , your so hapy to be here at the game instead of your crowd house ( it 's be pack since your brother @-@ inlaw lose his job and home ) , your credit card bill be go to be major after the game , homeland security will be investigate you because of a glitch in the facial i.d . software at the enterance , your job be be outsourced next wek , your team be lose million in endorsement , a major corporation pay million to sell their foreign made ware to you for justt a few second , and your car be be repoed in the lot .
we need voter that be n't sway by gimmicky corporate ad .
i love the ad till i see that it be for chrysler . consider they be own by fiat , " import from detroit " be a good slogan .
still a good ad , no matter who make it .
love the volkswagen one too .
there be high expectation , consider all the price they win with the darth vader one last year , but i think they manage to pull it off .
i do n't even know what a fiat be but after last night 's commercial i 'm buy two .
i have a hankering to send someone flower via teleflora too .
all and all , i think it be a very down year for super bowl commercial and i do n't even notice the chrysler one .
it be a bit too political for my taste but i do n't really care if car company want to spend a fortune on obama ad .
i 'm a happy camper as along as i 'm allow to cast my vote for who i think be the better candidate and make my annual political contribution of $ 0.00 to all campaign .
old clint be inspirational .
at one time the repubs would have think so as well .
but they have become infect , and be really sick .
emotionally and mentally sick than anyone have be in this nation in my lifetime .
they be not team player , they be so individualistic that it have become detrimental to the nation pull together , work together .
they have take individualism to a degree that it go against the evolution of one of the most social animal in the world , the human be .
and " share " be see by them as socialism .
it really be sad , in its most basic sense , because it hinder fix what their " every man be an island " philosophy that be tear apart the fabric of society .
forget guantanimo , forge the gulags , the chogm 2011 open that australia make the queen and various sundry head of state sit through be just plain evil .
i always assume these sort of thing be appal .
if the queen be n't turn up this would n't have much coverage here .
a bunch of foreign look folk all in one place only get coverage if a crime be commit ( they 'll get blame , even if they be the victim ) .
there have be a small amount of coverage of mr rajapaksa 's problem , but since the government be n't go to charge him wiht anything it go under the category of ' green bluster '.
do n't you wish duel be still legal .
it would solve so many problem .
imagine netanyahu challenge ahmadinejad to a duel at the un .
and ahmadinejad will have chavez as his second .
oh , happy thought..
actyooally , if a debt of honor be to be solve , there be no problem with , behind the tank shed at 4 or behind the bike shed after school , fisticuffs gadzooks , or in politico , s circle , in the duty free binge drink bar in the house of common .
i be hope for dueling between member of rival street gang .
i 'll even provide nice hollow point ammo for them to use .
or something like the thunderdome .
two men enter , one man leave .
mary travers , part of the trio of peter , paul and mary die yesterday after battle leukemia for many year .
i grow up listen to their music and get the chance to see them perform when i live in va .
i remember this group , and love some of their song .
it be in the 1960 s .
puff the magic dragon...
i can never hear that song without imagine an ac @-@ 47 or ac @-@ 130 type gunship lazily swing around in a constant circle , with sci @-@ fi lasergun @-@ look tracer pour out like evil glow rain...
no wonder those grade school psychiatrist be baffle .
hey folk @- i just find out that debbie have an apparently small fire at her house this morning .
i just talk to her and she 's home and physically fine and deal with the immediate aftermath so be too busy to talk .
i do n't know when she 'll have or use internet access in the next couple of day , but for those folk wonder who they could wish well this week , you now have a target .
that poor girl have bust her ass fix up her house and install a new heater and wood stove for the last six month and probably longer .
that really suck ! :(
i hope she be ok and the house be still livable in especially since she encounter very cold weather and consider where she life and all .
thank dale for let us know and please do tell her be think about her.:(
personally , i think they should peg it to inflation so that the pension have the same general purchase power over time , but i know that economically it would be a disaster as people be live more and more into their older year , far past when people would traditionally die .
the retirement age have not increase , but the amount of time on retirement have .
eventually , the military will do away with retirement benefit , or at least certain aspect of them .
it be not the british alone .
ask me .
that be life .
they use you and then discard you !
soon one understand that , one shall remain happy .
i be happy !
yet if the govt do away with retirement benefit the world over , there will be peace .
none will serve !
army , you have me worry there for a minute as " they should peg it " mean to die .
service pension be " peg " to inflation but usually cap to 2 %ish per annum , not much more .
servicemen should be recieving..service pension and state pension and if they be lucky a work pension .
time be hard and the forecast for the near future do not look too rosy .
the retirement age in the uk be due to rise in the future , at the moment retirement be 65 and government want to raise it to 70 .
i must say i also have little sympathy in this case .
assume h retire out of choice and be not wound , then it really be your own responsibility to handle your finance in my opinion .
the force be just a job like any other after all .
this very thing be drive home during my first retirement class .
in the usmc you be require to attend the first day of a week long retirement seminar .
the other day be optional .
but your choice not your unit .
around the middle of the day , the leader of the seminar start ask us if we be come back the next day .
about 70 % ( almost all combat arm guy ) say " no , we have thing we need to do at our unit ."
he say you all spent at least 20 yrs do thing for the corps . now take a week for yourself and be inform before you retire .
if any of you think that someone from headquarters marine corps care about you once they kick you out the door talk to a retiree .
no one from hqmc will call you to see how thing be go .
no one will call you a month later to see if you have a job yet or if there be anything they can help you with .
and you know what ?
no one ever do in an official capacity .
the only thing i ever get from them be a " we want you to come back on active duty as a full time reservist ."
you will have to give up your retirement and disability payment .
once we be do with you the retirement check won't start again until your 65 since you will be consider a reservist .
and you will have to start over from square 1 with the va .
the corps need you , do n't let us down ."
i have better thing to do .
i think i let them down .
all aboard be report safe .
aircraft drop in an apparent decompression state with passenger on oxygen from 40k in a controlled dive .
cause of the hole be unknown , aircraft be not old , be deliver in 1991 .
i 'm sure that it must have be alarm for all concern .
the hole be enormous .
i fly out of hong kong last week .
:( that could have very well be me !
despite now perform maintenance overseas , as dustin hoffman say in rainman , the only airline not to have have a crash ( jet aircraft that be )
and i have two client who work for qantas , one a 747 long haul pilot , the other a aircraft engineer .
let me open with a brief reminder ( or history lesson ) of one of the reason i first start watch this show :
now that be funny .
craig killborn be funny...
" the daily show " back then have ' ass @-@ kick ' interviews...
oh , yeah , and " five question " ( a wholy own subsidiary of craig industries...)
now we have a sit vice @-@ president appear on this show...
grant , a new host ( and grant the second clip be n't from the original " daily show ") but this be a news show ?
i 'd put in the biden clip , only ' twasn't to be find on the intar @-@ tubes... how droll...
anyhow , when do the " daily show " become such an institution of news that sit head of state would appear on such a thing ?
i guess it get gravity when lot of young kid start watch .
but you have to realize , obama go on leno , bill clinton and madeline albright have be on the daily show , and every democratic candidate for governor go on the colbert report .
the daily show be fun and very successful .
put pay to the whole o reilly fox crap that no one watch liberal .
jon stewart have a great job...he can give absolute free range to his opinion without any restriction that the regular news show have .
it 's no more a news show than o'riley , beck , olberman etc.
it 's a comedy show that have some commentary , stewart would be the last one to say it 's news .
if anyone be use this a real source of news , they need to get out more .
but still , he make me laugh and most of the time i think he have good point to be consider .
i know this clip be older , but i think he hit the nail on the head regard most of the commentary show .
it 's supposedly news satire , though amusingly it 's almost just as informative if not more than the actual news show run these day .
obviously stewart have some political message of his own thrown in .
similar show appear in other country as people get sick of how every news talk show end up be either a pure propaganda 's machine for one particular side or a bicker debate that do n't make sense to anyone .
taiwan have a version , though it use actor to cast as famous figure ( start mostly with political figure , but eventually end up with pretty much all sort of famous figure ) and they pretend to debate on a serious topic .
thursday there will be a vote on net neutrality...
how do you feel about the fcc get their hand on the internet ?
personally i have enjoy the only place for actual free speech...
do you want your internet censor ?
over my dead body ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!1
keep government away from the internet .
just read the actual law and the analysis .
this law be n't what it seem to be .
are they ever ?
the first rule of lawmaking be give the bill a name that be exactly the opposite of what it really do .
an emerge issue , how concern be you over drug violence in mexico ?
what potential do you see for drug violence to spill over more into the unite state ?
do you believe it to be enough of a threat that necessitate the us to take more action to do something about it , and if so , what action should that be ? ( e.g . border fence/wall , train for the mexican police/military , monetary aid to the mexican government , etc.)
this poll be intend for americans .
the drug violence in mexico start when the mexican president decide to " get tough " on the drug cartel .
guess what ?
they fight back .
just like the futile war on drug in the us , the drug war in mexico will have no greater success .
fight a war you can n't win be not noble .
it 's stupid .
stop fight the war on drug and the violence will go down .
we need to get the government out of the prohibition game once and for all .
legalize it , regulate it , and control it ( and tax it , too ! ) .
these drug killings be no different than al capone kill people during alcohol prohibition .
once drug deal ( aka beer , wine , and liquor sale ) become legal and regulate , murder in america drop dramatically .
plus we stop lock people up because they want to get drunk .
there 's more about this on my cop in the hood blog .
recently i learn about obama 's service plan , yeah may be late but better than never , and this be bother me .
accord to his website and other source i understand obama 's might mandate 100 hour of service per year when in college in exchange to $ 4000 of tuition credit .
to add this his chief of staff rahm emmanuel have confirm on 10 th nov to draft a plan in this regard .
further the follow be a quote form emmanuel 's book , the plan : big idea for america ,
if they be just to be " ask ", then it sound like a great deal .
though if it be , i see zero reason to limit it to college student age 18 - 25. if it 's require it 's nothing more than a civil service draft , slavery .
might as well be forcing ' em to work the cotton...
either way , good luck get a bunch of drunk @/@ stone college kid to add that workload to their college and job workloads .
as long as their just ask
imo its a fair price to pay .
this come from someone that foot their own college tuition , no mommy and daddy allowences , no grant or anything else .
and it will keep them out of trouble and teach them some thing as well .
imo a good call and for some perhaps a way to look at thing in a much better perspective .
awesome , $ 40/hr , that 's more than what i make .
let ' see... 100 hour of service for $ 4000 credit .
so for a trillion $ bailout , someone owe 25 billion hour ?
thats if they do not mandate... but if mandate... that 's communism... that the first step....
i think it be an excellent idea , people should be make aware of what to do in a crisis .
far to many people around the world today always expect someone to be there when a disaster strike , especially natural disaster .
here in new zealand everyone be teach how to cope and survive for up to at least three day without assistance from outside .
i realize he be not in office yet...
day 1 .
russia to move missile to baltic .
he 's already be test .
i 'm sure the russians want to gauge his reaction .
i cannot help but recall the age old expression that youth and enthusiasim be no match against wisdom and treachery .
obama get some clout as be the president elect of the us but i shudder when he go up against putin .
was there a specific strike that stand out ?
what be saddam do 2001 @-@ 2003?
obama will have to do something over the top like the four previous president before him do .
this savagery seem to be a requirement to prove one have the mettle to be " tough ."
nevermind that really be tough be work out a solution that do n't require bloodshed .
negotiate an end to un sanction with the french , germans and russians .
as far obama be concern , i would rather wait for his cabinet appointees...
to make bold prediction on what obama will do as president or what he will fail to do as president , one must wait to see who be the all the player .
would gwb have invade iraq if it be not for the gang of three ( wolfwitz , rumsfeld and cheney )?..
probably not , and probably george tennent would have still be run the war in afghanistan as least have some influence there .
never mine , but a classic example of how " power corrupt and absolute power corrupt absolutely "
then , you be consistent with your view , and there be merit in that .
perhapes , others from the other side of the aisle be only seek consistency , as well .
i give you an explanation as to why he do what he do ( in part thank to us ) .
as an anti @-@ war person , of course what he do be horrible .
i would put it akin to napalm or cluster bomb .
the innocent be murder in a savage manner .
why do the unite state need 12 aircraft carrier ?
we do n't .
that 's why we only have 11 .
smart @-@ arse .
why do the us have 11 carrier .
because 10 be not enough ?
how else can you muscle in on someone else 's turf ?
park a few carrier off the coast and make sure the despot do n't stray too far from the " american interest " angle .
you forget we also have 12 amphib carrier .
each one be as capable as any other carrier in the world . )
so it be in the paper today that the bush family and the obama family have meet up at the white house for a get together .
how do that go i want to know ?
do george walk around and whisper thing to barack like " see that security guard there ? thats ted .
do not make him mad ! !",
" careful this floor board squeaks...cant sneak in late down this hallway "
or " theres a secret to get this door lock , see you have to push on the door while pull upward ."
do the bushs show them around ?
are they just give a map and let loose ?
can they decorate however they want ?
let say barack want teal shag carpet in the oval office....can he do that ?
could michelle have the hallway paint neon orange if she want ?
do the kid get to pick their own room ?
will they have to share a bathroom ?
will they have to use a computer in the main live area so they be not accessing naughty thing on the internet ?
be the internet there block ?
could the obamas even access porn on the internet if they want ?
can the secret service hear thing from the outside of the door they be guard ?
what if the obamas just have a personality conflict with a maid or something ?
can they just fire them at will and have a new one sent over ?
could they keep a pet giraffe on the ground if they want to ?
if they want to get rid of the bowl alley and put in a discoteque could they do it ?
do they have to put a " do not disturb " sign on their bedroom door , or can they just lock it when they want some undisturbed time ?
and do the secret service knock and wait for an answer or just go charge into the bedrooms/bathrooms .
i wonder if they have ever " walk in " on a president .
there be this really nice site on the white house
very detail info and picture of most of the important room , span several era .
i think this show that pretty much every president can do any design thing they want with both the residence and the office wing
good question .
i too would love to know the answer .
i hope someone can help !
as per anderson 360 , the incoming first family get $ 100,000 to do any change to their live quarter of about 16 room .
also , any change that they can do be after consultation with historian , since ostensibly any change they would do would become a part of the nation 's history
that do not seem much , especially after consider the extensive change some previous president do .
not that i be complain ; thats my tax dollar that 's fund those lavender curtain
look like the national review have already start hedge its bet for a possible defeat .
i be surprise at this .
surely this be not the time to write down your won candidate
also , i do n't agree with the tone of the article that mccain 's principled position be cost his this election .
do you think far right party like the bnp in the uk should be accept as represent a decent part of society or should they be view as hate fill bigot ?
many work class english feel that the uk be no long great britain due to too many immigrant .
be it racist to think this if you live in an area with more ethnics then brits like inner city london ?
what do others think ?
do far right party deserve more respect or will they always be see as bigot .
yes it be .
in order to afford to stay in inner city london , a person , probably along with his family , have to have a monthly income that support this .
in order to do that a ethnic , have to have a stable job and thus already prove himself worthy . / rant over .
generally speak the work @-@ class in a nation have negative view of immigrant because they 're at the economic margin and view immigrant as competition for scarce opportunity .
i do n't see anything wrong with the long @-@ term concern on immigration that many in the uk may hold , but reform can be carry out through the mainstream party in britain without have to resort to a racist @/@ fascist party .
if you 're concern about immigration from the eu , then withdraw from the eu .
it 's a racist @/@ fascist party .
it may have moderate its tune , but that 's what it be at its core .
fail coup have lead to this trial with sir mark thatcher , spanish and south african government 's finger .
go to be lot of fun on this one .
accord to mannn the boss be calil and an ex @-@ british member of the cabinet .

not many arm dealer pay for helicopter for the " poor of africa "
be it guilty conscience ?
will we ever find out the whole truth ?
i doubt it very much
i do remember maggie fly out and pull every string she could to get him this . consider du toit get 32 year and mann won't see much less she save his life .
thank god for the french
we have all see the stereotype the frenchman defeat by germans in war ungrateful to the heroic american who have their back in ww2 or the snobby french people whole ignore tourist who speak english
but france be the western contradiction of the easts prejudice view
france maybe a white european ex @-@ colonial western democracy but by no mean be they right behind america or britain
when it come to do of think time and time again france have should the world
not all western nation be the follower of america as its be widely perceive
and i dont think the french will be demand that the chinese govt suppress the demonstration we have hear of in china
after all the chinese people be do what tibetan monk and exile be fight for to do in tibet - freedom to protest
( though i must say the attack on han chinese people have take a bit of credibility from the tibetan monk )
you know there be one job i do n't want this summer and that be the hcic security of the olympics .
rumour be now that western visitor be plan to protest during the olympics and consider the reaction today , we can expect a hell of a lot of kung fu .
that would be extremely distract when you 're on the look out for car bomb and ak @-@ 47s .
did the chinese police state let western media see what be actually happen unlike in tibet ?
when rally happen in communist state they be rarely not state support activity
yay for the french...at least one western democracy oppose communist police state still .
the chinese be mostly only buy unlicensed copyright infringe copy of name brand french goods anyway .
if they stop buy american dvds it would only mean license one .
go on ebay they even sell the knock offs to us .
the uhygurs be mostly moslem and an ethnic minority in western china with no self determination rule by a communist police state .
because some have join extremist group do not de @-@ legitmize the plight of an entire people .
i do n't under stand the problem people have with what be say by jack cafferty .
in the us we have think communist regime be thug and goon since stalin in the 50 s right ?
i think those ok with the chinese police state be really ok with the $ to be make there and they be never concern about freedom only the spread of market capitalism .
the chinese be brilliant in adopt large scale no regulation market capitalism thereby co @-@ opting so many americans who place capitalism and profit motive above a belief in democracy and freedom .
we really need to get out of bed with tyranny if we support freedom in the us
or rather they do n't know how to use it .
the individual tibetan have far more clout than the average han .
the number of poster here tout how good the tibetans have it be testament to that .
the problem be that the majority of tibetans be nowhere near the centre where that clout could benefit them .
they be in their little village .
yes , you may get 1 st seat at beijing university with far lower grades...
but you still have to study and go to beijing 1 st .
if you 're stuck in your village , you 're sol .
the other major problem be that because that very few chinese citizen who be knowledgeable enough to challenge the municipal government be nowhere near the tibetans .
even if the tibetans want to sue , they do n't know how and that open up to corruption and abuse since they know the tibetans won't take them to court over it .
i will be attend a meet with the veteran day parade committee .
we have a parade on or about veteran day in november down atlantic avenue in north long beach .
we have be do this for several year now and have have many vary entrant include mexican prancer horse , re @-@ enactors in various uniform ( include ww i and ww ii german ) , cavalry unit of various country ( the ww ii german cavalry " man " be actually a pretty girl use the helmet to hide her hair ) .
we have a problem last year in that a gay pride group want to be part of our parade but we keep them out with the excuse that they only suddenly show up and do not apply to be a unit .
this year we be be " ask " to include an anti @-@ war unit in the parade make up mostly of people protest the war in iraq .
any idea on this ?
besides the initial mistrust of " not believeing " they will not disrupt the parade , unless they be willing to sign a document state they will honour the one who give the ultimate sacrifice , and give thank to the one who be currently fight to ensure they " can have an opinion " and not in anyway disrupt the parade....then i would say no they cannot join the parade.......
if they will sign say socument then welcome to the parade .
i would guess both group want to politicise the event , which be after all to honour veteran , not make a political statement .
if they want a political rally , they can organise their own ,
if they want to participate as veteran then nobody 's stop them from parade with their unit .
if they be n't vet , it 's not their right to parade .
with the trouble in the world economy , and the pound rapidly lose value against the euro , be it time for the uk to adopt the euro ?
what be the advantage of britain adopt the euro , and what be the disadvantage ?
have the advantage or disadvantage change with the current financial crisis ?
it 'll cost a lot to do it which would not be advisable at the current time with the economic situation not look rosy ,
besides the people here would not stand for such a move .
so even if it make sense it would be political suicide to try and do it .
i just can n't imagine sit in a restraunt and order a human steak !
i 'm not even sure this url thing be gonna work but it 's a story about scientist grow meat in a vat ( stem cell research ) .
from yahoo science news friday 11 @/@ 20 @/@ 09 .
what do you think about this article/ if the url works... let me know .
vat grow meat instead of factory farm chicken/pork/beef ?
no more e.coli , mad cow , anthrax or foot and mouth to worry about .
seem like a good idea to me .
whats not to like ?
friend of mine in peru have a whole cookbook full of recipe for long pig .
hell , i 'd try anything once , but if i change my mind , bet andrew zimmer would be right there with a fork and a knife !
on this the 70 th anniversary of the attack on pearl harbor , we remember all those that be still entomb there and their shipmate !
we be here because they be there !
it seem as each year go by , more and more lesson of history be forget !
our fearless leader 's children 's private school be observe the day by serve japanese food for lunch !
the japanese be observe this day as well by tell everyone that it never happen or we make them attack us because we would n't give them thing .
if you ever get the chance to to watch the documentary about nanking and the other japanese atrocity during wwii you will be shock to find a picture take of a japanese private bayonet a civilian and the interview with that very private say he do n't do it as do many of the japanese soldier who do thing like this .
sorry , no love lose for the japanese .
the carrier jfk cv67 be due to arrive yesterday however she be hold off an additional day due to high wind in the area and will arrive today at the inactive ship reserve at the former pnsy where she will reside for the next two year in mothball .
41 year of service to the usn .
now it be only a matter of time before kitty retire and bring to an end the era of steam power cv 's in the usn .
they need to sell her for scrap and get rid of that float wreck .
why waste money maintain a ship that be in such bad shape , she could n't conduct air op before they decommissioned her ?
curious in part about how so many of the carrier get to be in . " poor material condition "
i 'm just confuse about the posibility of this happen can someone explain it to me ?
secondly wow have scrap and break gotten to be so expensive that its consider better @/@ more cost effective to do a sink @-@ ex wierd .
thats a massive amount of proccessed metal .
as more and more ship be build , the scrappers have more and more ship to scrap .
simply put , the scrappers be fall behind .
shipyard appear as manufacture plant ,
scrappers appear as junk yard .
plus there be glory in build wonderful ship , there be no glory tear the ship apart .
special occasion such as keel lay , ship christen , and commission ceremony deal with shipbuilding , no ceremony for scrap .
when you go to a store to buy a new shiny mop bucket , you feel happy to do so .
you feel lucky when you receive a new shiny roll of penny from the bank , you frown when its the old rusty roll of penny .
when you discard the rusty old mop bucket , you do n't feel sorry to do so . its people orient too .
since carrier cost so much , they be keep in service long .
many be of the age of old monochrome television set , or in the early day of color television set , you know the one without remote control .
you would n't think of buy a television without remote control today .
they be so old , they do n't make them any more .
with the carrier , they receive their mid @-@ life refit upgrade their electronics and electrical motor .
they have also receive their service life extension programs too , upgrade or replace their larger machinery component .
how many of us still have a 1960 s vintage refrigerator , washer and dryer , dishwasher , television , automobile , hot water tank , range and oven , etc.
us offer warship to india for first time
interest in that the usn be plan to prematurely decommission its mhc 51 osprey class mine @-@ hunt ship .
as regard amphibious ship the usn want desperately to decommission its steam @-@ power lha 1 tarawa class ( lha 3 belleau wood will actually be decommissioned this fall ) .
these ship will soon start turn thirty year old with no slep be undertake .
it be also say they have age much quicker than anticipate .
the usn pour a ton of money into the lpd 4 austin class ship to keep them go for 40 year ( in some case it will be 40 plus ) w/o a slep .
they dont want to repeat the experience .
eventually thsi may leave only eight lhd 1 wasp class ship until and if lha( r ) class ship get build .
also the lpd 17 san antonio class will be trucated at eight ship imho( some say seven others nine and nine have already be name ) .
this would also open up the possibility of prematurely decommissioning ship as many as four lsd 41 whidbey island class ship now turn 20 year old .
sell two lha 1 class ( plus grant two others as spare hulk ) and four lsd 41 class ship to india be intrigue imho .
this would give india a ready @-@ make credible amphibious force for very little cost .
with the demise of the battleship almost a certainty and only a handful , if any , of the ddx class ship to be built( plus the truncate lpd program ) the usn be poise to cut its amphibious force by 1 @/@ 3 .
the usn be also attempt to fast @-@ track its seabasing platform which theoretically would make @-@ up for the draw @-@ down in legacy amphibious warfare platform .
more on that sometime in the future .
just my analysis of the situation based on what be available from open source .
it be a good start because it add a whole dimension to the indian arm forces....
can land force through these transport anywhere in the indian ocean...
yeah , but i dont think it make that much of a difference...since we already have plenty of large land ships...which we can manufacture indiginously if necessary .
the land ship be something we can do without .
it be a very old decrepit ship that need a huge major overhaul to bring it up to today 's standard .
in would be better off buy a new ship with that kind of money .
india is buy ship trenton ( lpd @-@ 14 ) .
not because of its war make capability .
but to move humanetarian aid in asian region like in case of tsunami .
indian navy do not have big transport ship like trenton which can land material on sea beach etc.
it only have magars class land ship . so if indian navy get this ship , then i think it be ok .
at least it will get a cheap ship for do mostly humaneterian work .
war make will be secondary work for this ship .
and this is the only reason that americans have suddenly agree to supply india this particular ship .
regard agis radars .
it be a seperate item .
why be you discuss it on this thread .
first let us buy this ship , then we can discuss others .
this be what happen when you take shipboard safety for grant .
tank be always dangerous .
ive be in many and hate every second of it .
i get deride and laugh at alot for the seemingly overcaustiousness i always undertake .
people die if you dont .
i prefer not to die thisway.:
tank be very dangerous place .
we be always teach in first aid @/@ rescue never to enter a tank if there be someone unconsious inside...
cause you would be next .
unnecessary tragedy .
i read a story relate to the clean trychlrothylene use to clean a tank in the rn back inthe 70 s , the guy be around it too long that his mylenin ( the fatty cover around the spine ) be eat away by it and he go bonkers for a few hour and then die .
hell you have to take alot of caution when you be work in closed area with noxious fume , even build model you can get mess up off the paint if you dont have an open window .
yank out , bomber in , 12 bomb , dozen kill , control battle start , sunnis v shites , million of dollar @/@ pound spend , life lose , for what , for sweet fuck all that 's what ,
iraqi force have no chance of control ,
iraq be gonna get worse now than before the west try to make it better
the innocent be gonna suffer just like before .
let get out of ag as well leave the village tribal idiot to it .
if push come to shove , slash n burn , waste no more life n cash on useless campaign 's . imo
do this surprise anyone ? exclude our glorious leader of course
imo , the iraqi 's screw themselves by give into the sadrists and others .
as mention before the us should have punch his ticket and his army of idots before depart iraq .
once again politics interviened and spare their sorry ass .
this be what they get in return for that stupid decision .
the large " gray area " know no boundries . and once you let religion into politics instead of keep them seperate the black and white disappear depending upon who you be and only gray exist .
a very dismal commentary .
there be no doubt that repeat deployment in the combat zone do wear out individual . it do lead to whole lot of man management and domestic problem .
and it do create innumerable problem for the govt which have to maintain its aim and deliver .
a catch 22 situation .
that the troop be still manage speak very highly of their dedication and patriotism and they should be commend .
to overcome this problem , one way could be draft .
but that would be a political suicide .
also , a draft will not guarantee that the soldier would be better .
in fact , many misfit would be in , lead to greater problem as be see in vietnam .
one of the solution be to have a volunteer force of all nationality like the french foreign legion ( be discuss elsewhere in the forum ) .
all say and done , a difficult situation indeed , but the national aim cannot be forsake !
it 's just one person 's point @-@ of @-@ view , but from what i can tell , there 's lot of fight leave in these guy .
i 'm around centcom 's warrior all day every day , and i can tell you that they do n't seem tire and worn out to me .
one stat i keep see thrown around be the approval @/@ disapproval rate of how the war be be conduct .
but if only one third of the troop like the way we 're go about the business of win in iraq , that do not necessarily mean they 've lose faith in the mission .
hell , as for myself , i 'm not crazy about how we 're proceed , either .
but that do n't mean i do n't believe in the mission .
far from it - i want to go at the job hard . i want to win .
i want the surge to be big , soon , and to last as long as it take to win .
so , although it 's only my perspective here and back by absolutely no number , stats or fact other than what i know from personal observation , i simply do not see the impending crash come .
what i can tell you that i do see be a frustrate will to victory , and a sense that our leader and people be not as commit as we be .
bluesman , this repeat turnover and its effect i understand to some degree since we ( indian army infantry unit ) be always back in the ci grid after every two year .
if we be send without this break , i be sure we would have get really feed up .
as it be , we have start have problem inspite of this two year layover in peace station , since the standard of live have go up and our troop be get urbanised and soft .
we also have the advantage that we be from the same unit for life in most case and so the cohesiveness be more and we know each other well .
i believe in the us army , soldier can be post to any unit .
what be the time gap between turn over for iraq ?
you 'd have to work around them to truly understand what i mean .
otherwise , i just do n't think you 'd really be able to see it the way i do .
in my job , i work with all the inter @-@ agency player , and i never experience the kind of inertia and drag with anybody else .
this be absolutely the truth : the state department wonks down here do not want to be associate with the word ' kill ', as in my branch 's mission of ' capture or kill enemy high @-@ value individual '.
that 's what we attempt to do ; that 's what they want no part of .
and you 'd have to be here to know what it be to be frustrate and impede by people that vehemently object to your very existence .
i wish i could express it in a way that you would know what i mean .
( you probably think i 'm just impatient with bureaucracy , which i be , or that it 's a squabble about method , and there 's certainly those , too .
but it 's more than that.)
then , i think , you would not think it too strident to say they have an antipathy toward an american victory .
bluesman , i have n't work inter @-@ agency , so i trust you know best .
however , in their defense , i would like to mention that
1. the pinstripers have n't be exactly beloved or respect by the bush administration .
some of this be fair ( state be all but ignore in 2003 ) , some of this be not ( bureaucratic irritation at the initiative kick them out of comfortable perch and into wot hotspots ) .
2. cia have get plenty of ex @-@ military , and there 's enormous pressure to get more .
i trust that i break no state secret by tell you that if you head over to langley , you will see a lot of twenty @-@ somethings and lot of fifty @-@ year old senior staff , and not much in between . the lack of a middle be really make ' em push for ex @-@ military to fill that .
i can assure you that patriotism be high up on their value , more so than ever .
i 'll try to explain my perspective on all this .
it might ramble at time .
i be for the war , still be if it could be fight properly , but it can n't be .
bush 's goal be a secure iraq , with a function gov't that can police the country and be an american ally in the war on terror .
this will not happen .
my knowledge be all second hand , but that 's all i have to go on .
i 'm see a picture of a nation of subhuman savage .
did anyone ever bother to ask why saddam do the thing he be hang for ?
we 're see the answer to that question .
these people need a dictator who 's willing to use mass murder when they step out of line .
unfortunately we be n't prepare to use similar tactic , so this war be unwinnable .
if it be up to me , everytime an ied go off we 'd get our people out , draw a circle on a map with at least a 500m radius around the point of the blast , and turn that area into a smoke crater .
and i do n't care if there 's a school full of kid there with class in session .
do that a few time and these " people " might start to behave better .
we can surge troop all we want , but if the level of cruelty do n't increase it will all be pointless .
that 's the only thing they understand .
i can n't believe i be stupid enough to buy all the tripe about what iraq could become if we just remove the dictator .
i also have some problem with bush that i do n't have when i vote for him , based on his piss poor performance .
he 's recently change policy to go after the iranian agent that be supply the militia .
we 've see story that the cia have be track these iranians for over two year .
why change now ?
why do n't we whack them as soon as they were identify ? ??
how many americans be dead or maim because bush be play some diplomatic footsy game with iran ?
there be two of our border agent in prison for do their job , and twelve marine sit in jail in san diego for hit the wrong house after they be attack in haditha .
bush have n't lift a finger to help either of those group of men , and that 's why imo bush have show himself to be nothing but an honorless pig .
can someone talk me out of this ?
because it 's look pretty damn bleak to me .
ieds : the lazy man 's insurgency
it 's time to take another look at iraq , because there 's be a big change in insurgent tactic in 2005. that 's inevitable . war make people on both side think faster . peacetime army never learn anything ; wartime army learn new trick faster than a hungry raccoon .
the big change be that the insurgent have decide to rely on ieds rather than ambush with shoulder @-@ fire weapon to kill the two or three gis per day they figure they need to wear down the us public 's will to stay in the fight . and it 's work , way too well .
the stats be clear : ied victim make up a bigger chunk of our casualty every month . over the last six month , ieds have cause 63 % of us combat death . last month ( october 2005 ) be typical : out of 96 us troop kill , ieds be responsible for 57 .
compare that with april 2004 , a terrible month when we lose 140 troop . back then the insurgent relied on rpgs and small arm . only 19 of our 140 kia that month @-@ barely more than a tenth @-@ be kill by ieds .
the insurgent have decide to do it the easy way . as long as they can use ieds , their low @-@ tech standoff weapon , why should they risk close combat ?
the real question be why they can get away with it . and here @-@ well , i hate to keep say this , but somebody need to . the reason they can do it be because we still have no intel on them . it 's the biggest failure of the war , and nobody talk about it . ci warfare be about people , not hardware . we 're all hardware and no intelligence , like a tim allen show . make me sick .
that make the decision to go with ieds a no @-@ brainer for the insurgent . in the standard ambush , the kind we be face a year ago , the insurgent detonate an ied under a convoy , then open up on the stall survivor with rpg and small arm fire . it probably make them feel good , sort of their version of shock and awe , but the rifle fire be ineffective and by concentrate their force , the insurgent make themselves vulnerable to our air power .
the problem in any guerrilla battle be the getaway . anybody can pull a trigger ; the trick be get your men home safe , while enemy chopper zoom through the sky and every street be full of troop and armor look for men of military age . that 's the tough part .
an ied ambush have none of those risk . only one man need to be on the spot @-@ the triggerman . he detonate the ied from a car park down a side street and drive away before the occupier can even start their search . no risk . no casualty . very demoralize for the occupier , especially since they know damn well that everybody in the neighborhood be in on the attack but they can n't level the local ' shack like they 're die to .
what make this wave of ieds worse be that the device be get more effective . frankly i 've be shock at how good the iraqis be with these thing right from the start . i mean , after that shameful performance in gw i , do you expect these bastard to be so sneaky , patient , and smart ? i know this war be a bad idea , but even i never realize what we 'd be up against .
the scariest tech development of all be that the insurgent have learn how to make shape @-@ charge ieds . to understand why shape charge be such a powerful weapon , we have to go into the incredibly cool world of explosive physic . i love this stuff . i mean , what red @-@ blood american boy do n't experiment with explosive ? the only reason i ever open my chem book be to see if it mention tnt or dynamite in the index . ( it do n't @-@ goddamn hippie teachers.) and naturally i use the local wildlife , like toad and bee , in my experiment with the kill power of firecracker .
what i learn be the most important point about the subject : blast alone do n't do a good job of kill the target . a bee would wobble off unhurt after one of my 4 th of july daisycutters go off right next to it .
now before you hothead whose hobby be make pipe bomb in the garage write me angry letter ( or send me long round package with no return address ) , i know a blast can kill , if it 's a big enough blast . we have a really nasty example of that in august this year , when a huge ied kill 14 marine near haditha . from what i 've read , investigation show there be nothing special about the ied . it be just three anti @-@ tank mine stack in a pile @-@ the ihop of ieds , i guess you could call it .
that ambush show real clearly how important intelligence be in guerrilla warfare . the same unit that suffer the ied attack have just have six of its sniper kill in a small @-@ arm ambush . now you tell me how anybody can ambush six sniper unless they 've completely penetrate the unit . the insurgent know where the unit 's sniper would assemble , and they know where the vehicle would be pass . we do n't know a thing about the enemy , but it 's clear that he know way too much about us .
the other problem be that the 14 marine be ride in one of those ridiculous land craft the corps use as apcs @-@ in haditha , hundred of click from the sea ! it 's call the aav @-@ 7a1 , and it look like a giant armored dinghy . since it be design to ferry troop ashore , it sacrifice armor and speed and damn near everything else to an amphibious capability that have no use anymore . but that 's the corps for you . real brave , but not always real smart .
maybe if those guy have be in a real apc some would have survive . i can n't say . if the blast be big enough , it can kill even an mbt . the pal take out two israeli merkavas , the best @-@ armored tank in the world , with simple blast ieds .
but most of the time , guerrilla do n't have the delivery system to depend on blast power . if they 're try to kill soft target @-@ i.e . people @-@ they pack the bomb with homemade shrapnel : roof nail , ball bearing , anything that 'll shred flesh . a suicide vest tip with nail be basically a 360 @-@ degree 12 gauge .
to kill gis that way , you need to catch them off @-@ guard , somewhere they feel safe . that 's what happen when a jihadi kill more than a dozen of our guy in a mess hall in mosul while they be have lunch -- minus their body armor .
in the field , us troop be a hard kill , especially because they move in armored convoy protect by chopper . and that 's the real beauty of ied attack for a guerrilla : they absolutely nullify us air power . there be literally no target for the attack chopper . the pilot know damn well that one of those iraqi car drive away from the scene be carry the guy who set off the ied , but there 's no way to tell which one .
in a strange way , we 're look at a 3d war . we control the air , but the iraqis literally control the underground , thank to these buried ieds . we fly , they dig .
the insurgent ' first ieds be simple . not that there 's anything wrong with simple . the weapon that have be hurt us be all simple , like the rpg . simplicity be the guerrilla 's friend .
those early ieds were usually just shell bury by the road , wire up to a detonator . lot of amateur be tinker in their garage , or whatever iraqis have instead of garage , play with stuff that go boom . and naturally lot of those guy go boom themselves .
like i say , war teach people fast , but some of the lesson have to be learn by the next of kin , not the handyman whose bright idea for a new type of bomb turn him into an abstract paint all over his wall .
sometimes an insurgency have to learn its lesson several time . take the case of pressure @-@ trigger ieds . these be basically standard anti @-@ vehicle mine , with something like a bathroom scale as trigger . people and car can pass over them unharmed , but if a really heavy ( mean armored ) vehicle roll over that scale , the bomb go off . ( truck be a problem . some truck weigh as much as an apc.) the best part be that you do n't even need a triggerman to set it off . you can all be off at the hookah parlor polish up your alibi when it go off .
the insurgent in baqouba use pressure bomb in 2003 , but they usually fail to go off . their bombmakers do n't have the technique yet .
thank to info @-@ share , the internet give an insurgency , they 're back at it , with better wire diagram . a week ago ( oct . 24 ' 05 ) , a pressure bomb shred a humvee in baqouba , tear four gis leg to piece .
the first ieds be mostly mortar round that fail against our armor . so the insurgent go to big 155 mm round . that 's a big , big shell and when you trigger it at the right moment , it 's go to kill almost anything but an m1 .
the m1 be a great tank , so it 's kind of scary to read the stats on how many of them the insurgent have manage to knock out . as usual , the invasion be the easy part and the occupation be when thing get lethal . we only lose 18 m1s in the conventional fight , but the guerrilla have since manage to disable 80. now most of those be track damage , but that 's enough to put a tank out of action .
the good news be that the m1 have live up to its rep for crew protection . the army 's armor center say only five crew have die in ied attack on m1s . ( ten other m1 crow have be kill , mostly by sniper fire , ride in open hatches.)
so if you 're an insurgent bomb @-@ maker , your goal be to find a way to kill m1s . not just knock a tread off , but destroy it and kill the crew . and that 's where the shape @-@ charge ied come in . shape charge be develop for tank kill , use in mbt anti @-@ armor round and antitank weapon . their warhead be basically thick cup of soft metal . metal with low melt point , usually copper . the bomb @-@ maker 's job be to make sure as much of the force of the blast be channeled to the copper cone as possible . so sometimes he 'll put several 155 mm shell beneath the copper , or pack a whole lot of tnt under it .
when the ied detonate , this copper cup turn into a shaft of superheated metal that can zip right through any armor , even an m1 's . that 's what they tell me , and i have to believe it .
it 's the kind of weird science that use to frustrate me in physic , the sort of info you just have to take on faith . i can n't help wonder if they 're kid us civvies about it all . i do n't get why a soft metal like copper can penetrate chobham armor , which can defeat almost any warhead around .
apparently the copper be n't even actually melt . it eject as a solid ; it just " behave like molten metal." i 'm sure the insurgent home improvement tinkerers do n't understand the science involve any more than i do . they just hear that it work and try it out .
the us countermeasure have be pretty lame so far . convoy travel with jammers that make it harder to detonate the ied by cell phone or garage door opener @-@ nokia and genie sale be go to drop in the sunni triangle . but like i say , low @-@ tech be the guerrilla 's friend . these day they 've go back to wire , and i hear some be even use string . you can n't jam a string .
beyond that , bush policy be to blame iran , or syria , or satan or whoever .
iran ? maybe . syria ? no way . syria 's scared to death , ready to do anything to make uncle sam happy . and if it be iran , what can we do about it ? there be still a few neocons so totally out of their little gourd they want us to invade iran . i have to wonder if they 're agent of dr evil , programme to destroy america . because invade iran would do it , it 'd end us once and for all .
this blame stuff be a sign of frustration . nobody know how to stop ieds , even with all the popular mechanic geeks send in their garage @-@ tech brainstorm . that 's because @-@ damn , how many time do i have to repeat it ? -guerrilla war have no technical solution . or even military solution . the only effective ci technique be torture , reprisal and , ultimately , genocide .
my guess be that genocide will come back one day . that be how the ancient dealt with rebellious town : wipe ' em out . one of these day some first @-@ world country be go to get impatient and a problem child like the sunni triangle will be a big , radioactive ghost town .
if we do n't do it , the kurds may end up do it the old @-@ fashion way they learn from the turks : one bullet , one village at a time . it 's be do before -- seen any armenians up there lately ? probably not , but most of " kurdistan " use to be " armenia." a few of the armenians make it to fresno , but the rest be bury up there .
we 're talk about mesopotamia here , the place where war be invent . hundred of people have be wipe out forever in those part . all these holocaust lobbyist get furious if anybody say jews be n't the only tribe to get genocided , but that 's just politics-" our genocide be better than your genocide ! "
the fact be , genocide be , historically , the most common result when one tribe run into another . and something tell me the next big wipeout will happen right there in central iraq .
it have a large sky be fall slat but decent read on the ieds...
it be true that the ieds be effective .
it be not a " lazy man 's insurgency " but a " cunning and diabolical man 's insurgency "
raj ,
sorry , as i state , i do n't have much time , but the wife now have the newborn .
a few superficial criticism :
1. it 's not ci ( counter @-@ intelligence ) . ci be when you thwart your enemy 's intel operation . thus , gain intel on when @/@ where the insurgent be plant ieds be intel , not counter @-@ intel .
2. iraqis do n't have garage at their house . thus , i would conclude that this guy have never step foot in iraq .
some meaty criticism :
1. the marine 's aav be as armored as the standard army apc - the m113. it sound as if this pundit be probably a former army guy . based on the damage to the single aav that be involve , unless it be a m @-@ 1 , more armor would n't have help . that 's how big the ieds be get .
2. a single 155 mm round do n't do any significant damage to us armored vehicle ( the up @-@ armored hmmwv be n't a true armored vehicle in the sense that it be design from the ground up with armor in mind - it be modify from a cargo vehicle ) . for example , on the stryker , a 155 mm round will scratch some paint off and flatten tire .
3. war be like a sport . it be interactive and tactic , technique , and procedure evolve continuously in reaction to your opponent . back to the sport analogy , if you 're get kill in a zone defense , you switch to man @-@ to @-@ man , etc. he seem to apply a template that the enemy of the us should be dumb and not react . underestimate your enemy be a bad and dumb thing to do .
4. he fail to mention the intel that we get that allow us to defuse the majority of ieds before they be detonate .
5. he fail to mention how switch back to wire device make it easier to catch the trigger man .
6. he fail to mention how use larger device mean that you need to spend more time prepare the site , which mean a greater chance of compromise .
7. he complain about intel , but then advocate harsh technique that run contrary to the value of the us and do n't weigh the impact that these technique would have on gain intel from the population and @/@ or bring the population off the fence and to our side . his recommendation would result be less intelligence - gain some information from a pay triggerman may result in a few short @-@ term success within a particular cell , but it will alienate the population and result be less intel over the long @-@ run from the population and future cell that would be create down the road due the increase perception of occupation through the harsh technique he advocate . as an example , abu ghraib , which be the direct result of a half @-@ dozen irresponsible individual that be able to conduct their abuse due to the lack leadership of their supervisor , have a huge negative impact on our relation with local iraqis . the trust we have build with many be erode and our ability to gain trust with others be much more challenge .
bottomline , he do n't truly analyze the situation from all aspect and use some faulty assumption and some fact that be flat out wrong . in the end , you have the action @-@ reaction @-@ counteraction cycle that be produce bigger ieds that be easier to catch , but more deadly if you do n't catch it . i 'm not state that it 's not a problem , but this analysis do n't offer much value .
i hope this help . as far approach to coin , i 'm sure that ray , lemontree , dave angel , and some of the others on this board whose militaries have be do coin for much longer than the us ( which , btw have do coin quite frequently , but then shun it as a freak occurance and do n't internalize the lesson learn in favor on focusing on the " big threat ") can comment at length on why this article espouse the wrong approach to the problem .
i 'm just wonder what indian poster think your government 's reaction would be if australia ask for finish nuclear weapon and missile , plus nuclear know how , with you for under the table shipment of yellowcake for your nuclear weapon program ?
you see , i 'm hope that one day befor it be too late that australia will wake up to the fact that we can n't rely on the us to be willing to lose a city over us by hold true on the ' nuclear umbrella ', if ever we have a conflict with china .
by ship you yellowcake from say a secret source on defence land acqured for ' train ', we could keep it outside the npt inspection treaty process so you can build bomb with it .
we ould even fly in vet indian miner ( with train ) to avoid the secret get out here . it would benefit us by allow payment to be make outside our budget approprations process , which be transparent .
once we have our missile we can announce that we be join you in the non @-@ align movement , transport weapon grade uranium between us openly and generally ignore all the complaint it would generate and other people war , just like you do now .
do this work for you ?
it would n't be that hard for australia to build nukes by yourselves .
involve outsider usually increase the amount of headache you have to deal with .
imo , every " first world " - technologically modern nation could probably do it today - some have choose not to ( like japan and germany ) perhaps because of history ?
i think australia probably could do it if they want too , and the rest of the world would n't object as much as they would if one of the historically agressive non @-@ nuclear nation do it .
a lot of the nuclear weapon tech that be unattainabe 20 @-@ 30 year ago be attaintable now . it would be very expensive , and there would be consequence .
why should we sell ?
the only reason we would be if we really need the money or if the yellowcake be not available elsewhere or if you be the only one who have something we really need from an existential perspective as barter .
it could and would probably work if india be to place their own nukes under indian control onto australian soil .
for your defense and our own .
expand deterrent .
but then you have that option already with the us , so the fact that you ask this question probably point to a drift in confidence or the fact that you feel you would be able to better control an indian nuke umbrella to your prime advantage versus a us one .
tired of the ever @-@ hulking , always @-@ advance glacier of dvd and bd case in my live room , i 've procure a media server and a boxee box to run it .
my plan be to migrate all of my media ( probably about 700 dvds and bds , count all the tv show i have ) onto the server over the next year or so , and banish the hardcopy to a closet for backup .
media server with 6tb storage run freenas life in the basement , boxee box hook into av stack ( plasma , bd player , cd player , cable box , receiver ) life upstairs , cat @-@ 5 network .
so far i 'm get great quality playback from some item , but real movie that i 've rip be not great .
i 've play with a few different programs , but i like dvdfab the most so far .
do anyone know if it 's really a " bit - to - bit clone ", or be i get some default compression even if i 've set that to 0 % ? -@ dale
if there 's a visible difference between the dvd and the copy then it 's be compress .
sometimes the format you decide to convert it to have issue .
i seldom do it so i 'm not really au fait with what be good but the software i use be handbrake and convert it to either.mov file or uncompressed mpeg4
nifty thread .
i be think of implement a rather lower cost option .
manually rip all dvds to mkvs , make a little htpc with a low cost amd llano cpu and a wireless card and hook it up to my tv .
for any gamers out there.. the rumor thread for " call of duty 6 "..
what the game would be like ?
so far its a split between semi @-@ scifi( halo ) or literally modernwarfare2( cod4 ) with new map and missions..
cod 5 be a disappointment when they decide to go back to the same old world war 2 theme..
i 'd personally prefer them add new map and mission to cod4...
cod4 to me be the best real @-@ war based fps...
maybe more ' politically bold mission ' like chechnya , kashmir , afghanistan , nwfp/waziristan..maybe even cuba/n.korea..
just hope they dont overdo the middle @-@ eastern theme which they pull off so well in cod4
if it be " semi @-@ scifi "( they 're rumored to be look for a sci @-@ fi title ) ..
i 'm stumped..
how 'd they possibly pull @-@ off semi scifi without look like a bad copy of halo..
they should do some type of geurilla warfare game set in a wartorn african or south american country .
that could be interesting , like a fps contra .
i hope they make the plot as interesting as the last one .
somilian pirate @/@ mexican drug cartel would bear the hell out of me .
ps : cod 5 be pretty good .
i do n't know why people hate it so much .
cod 6 - one word - awesome ! !!...
the trailer look great .
plus i get what i want - an extension of modern warfare 1 instead of yet another world war 2 scenario .
look like they pack a lot more mission into cod 6 compare to cod 4 .
i be so look forward to october !
this be so much better than last year when i see the cod 5 trailer ( flamethrower and all ) and all i could think of be - " oh dear..."
since many of our troop be stuck in iraq , it be likely that we may not have the resource to be able to send troop to iran .
so there be great likelihood that israel may act alone .
although israel have greater air and ground superiority then iran , iran have larger number of troop and have long range missles that can reach israel .
israel in the past have sucessfully fight off nation with larger number of troop before a prime example be the six day war .
so would israel be able to act alone or would us military intervention still be require to attack iran ?
israel would find it hard enough to conduct air raid on iran , let alone fight a large scale war .
the distance be simply too great for israel to be able to project much power against iran .
i do n't think israel could act alone .
if they attack iran unilaterally , it would probably be a large mission aim at take out iran 's nuclear infrastructure .
they would have a hard go of it .
iran in retaliation would launch its long range missile at israel , as well as encourage hezbollah to harass israel .
i think any israeli action against iran would involve bring the us into the war , i think its the only way israel can really do enough damage to make the whole effort worthwhile .
i have be search for sometime now , and i can n't seem to find a dropshipper that sale merchandise low enough so i could profit from it .
would someone please help me ?
hi , nobody be go to give you their source .
you be go to have to find them on your own .
there be plenty out there but most of them be more trouble than they be worth .
there be also a very few that be good supplier but you have to realize , when dropshipping , the profit margin be very thin and you have to be on top of them all the time , monitor their inventory .
people find a dropshipper , sign up and then list , list , and list !
they list soooo much but then when it come to monitor the inventory they do not check back into the site to see if the inventory be still available .
you can have a successful business with dropshippers but it be w*o*r*k .
it be not e*a*s*y .
i find all my source by surf the net on my cellphone during commercial , while wait in line , any spare moment .
search several different way , most do not even have the word " dropship " on their site .
good luck .
and beware of " membership club " such as doba and the like .
they be not your solution .
real distributor do not charge you for take your money .
still , make any drop ship work in the dsr @-@ feedback @-@ orient quick ship ebay world will be a challenge .
please do a quick search and you will find ton of info on drop shipping...here be a thread from the recent past http : //forums.ebay.com/db1/topic/building @-@ an @-@ ebay @/@ use @-@ a @-@ drop/5200052702?#msg5200760329
which be only of about 25+ since the begin of the year .
i be sorry but until ebay pin the drop ship topic all you can do be search older post .
i cannot give you the formula for success , but i can give you the formula for failure -- which be : try to please everybody . herbert bayard swope
my partner and i refuse to use dropshipping .
if a dropshipper have 100 item for example and we sell 107 to 107 different people then we have 7 potential unhappy customer with the potential for 7 negative feedbacks .
a dropshipper be only concern with sell their 100 item as fast as they can .
i be concern with sell the 100 item that be in our inventory as best and correctly as possible .
this be just my opinion.....
ok...i know the answer to that but it still really bother me .
this be what be wait for me when i log into facebook this afternoon
no ! ebay should issue a coupon for buyer to use on our listings and get 15 % off....
we would still get our full $$ and ebay can give the seller the difference that the buyer save !
just really bug me
because that be additional revenue outside of seller .
seller be captive revenue that will be about the same no matter what they do ,
until someone else come along and challenge ebay they will keep on do the same thing , but soon or later that will happen , , , .........i hope soon
, ...,most people do n't realize that the best answer be the one that they do n't want to hear . chan
yup..i know the answer but still hate it !
sorry , long story .
first off a little info..
marshall amplification have be one of the lead guitar amplifier company for 50 year .
many of the older amp be be restore and also there be countless company offer clone and cloned replacement part for diy'ers .
since i like wood work i think some folk would enjoy an amplifier shell that they could finish themselves and either use it to restore an old marshall amplifier or to collect aftermarket part from countless other vendor and end up with a vintage marshall clone .
so , i have have pretty good luck sell these wooden amp head shell in the past and think i would reintroduce my product .
well , ebay pull my list for have the word " marshall " in the title .
my actual list read " marshall style plexi @/@ jcm800 headshell for project ."
notice the word " style ".
i do a quick ebay search use " marshall style " and come up with 100 's of listings that use that term for after market part and kit .
the listings i click on be not actaul marshall product .
i also search another famous amplifier company and type in " fender style ".
again 100 's of listings for aftermarket part and kit .
why be i singled out when there be 1,000 's and 1,000 's of people list this way ?
and its clear that i do not claim it be an actual " marshall " product which be why i put the word " style " in the list .
do not seem right .
people who be look for these item won't find them without know that it be for a marshall or marshall style amp .
i love the smell of package tape in the morning .
can n't use the manufacturer 's name in the title unless the item be list be actually make by the manufacturer .
ebay rule - not mine .
michael 's right - someone somewhere decide to report you , and you end up get a wrist @-@ slap .
you -@ could @- start report all the " style " listings you find and ( hopefully ) watch them go away .
sometimes it only take one report... sometimes you gotta stay on top of it for a while .
there be special rule for what you want to do , offer non @-@ brand replacement component ( in your case , the wood case ) .
unfortunately , i just do n't recall what they all are...
there 's a way to word the description that work and do n't get you slap for " keyword spamming " ( which be what put marshall in the descriptive text will earn you ) .
fun stuff , eh ?
that sound right...
as long as it do n't fall into the not allow category by meet this criteria :
use " compatible with , " " fit , " or " for " before a brand name in the title of your list to describe item that be universally compatible or that be compatible with an entire product class
just know if it be someone that be " after you " ( which sometimes happen ) - there be always some violation that you be break or you be near the questionable portion of break some policy .
because ebay will usually " pull first ask late " when a list be report , your listings will only become better and you may just sell more because of what you learn on how to become a better seller as you refine your listings .
if you keep a good sense of humor and communicate with ebay... ebay will start " ask first pull late ".
hello ,
i wonder if someone can clear something up for me ?
i have a £63,950 svr mortgage with halifax with 19 1 @/@ 2 year leave . ( it 's currently £64,570 due to some stupidity a few yrs ago ) .
now , this be originally take out as interest only but when i 've phone a couple of year ago to increase the payment they have change it to " part interest , part repayment ". not too fuss about this as i 've work out the number and the correct amount be come off the capital every month .
i 'm go to contact halifax for detail on how to make overpayments as i 've increase my direct debit again but would like to be able to make ad @-@ hoc overpayments when i 'm able to .
thing i 'm curious about be the 10 % overpayment thing - i know my mortgage agreement be subject to this however what do it really mean ? should i only be pay 10 % more than my interest only payment or be it 10 % extra off the capital ? my new direct debit ( as of end dec 12 would take me over the 10 % of io payment ) .
i 'm guess they will give me a rough idea of how much i can overpay in £s based on my current direct debit but would be interested to know beforehand just for my knowledge .
currently halifax have on their record that " pension " will be pay the capital off at the end of the term - these be currently non existent so try to get myself at least on track for repayment at the end of term .
thank very much !
its 10 % of the mortgage balance for the year , so if your mortgage balance in £100,000 that year you can overpay by £10,000 during the course of the year without penalty .
however , if you be on the svr you dont have the 10 % limit , just overpay as much as you can comfortably afford
quote :
are you sure you 're on svr ? or just a rate that be soon to end ?
have work for halifax it be indeed correct that once you 've reach the svr then no overpayment limit be enforce you be simply free to overpay as much as you wish to .
this be correct . your kfi @/@ mortgage offer may say something along the line of ' in any one year you may repay up to 10 % of the amount outstanding on your special rate product '. it 's a roll 12 month , so the year start when you make your 1 st overpayment . so , you could n't pay £10k in december and another £10k in january for instance , you 'd need to wait 12 month .
then , once your ' special rate product ' end , you go onto svr , with no overpayment restriction .
hi , i 'm in the middle of a divorce and am try to take on the mortgage on the family home .
i 'm only try to borrow about 16 % of my home 's current market value , which be about twice my annual income .
have approach several big lender and try go through a financial adviser , but noone will lend because my income be make up of : 4 very part @-@ time job ( 2 employ , 2 self @-@ employ ) , maintenance ( not yet court order ) and tax credit .
their argument be that once my daughter leave school some of these income source will cease , but by then i would hope to be back at work full time ( she 's only 7!).
the mortgage rate i 've be quote be less than i 'm pay at the moment anyway !
it 's be suggest to me that i try and take out a personal loan instead ?
anyone get any suggestion ?
you would think that have 4 part time job that at least you will have 2 at any one time and that be more secure than have 1 full time job and possibly be give notice to leave .
it sound like you be self employ and will need the assistance of an accountant to create some book that show some decent profit combine all the source of income stream as one source of income .
they may be do an affordability calculation instead of a income multiple and do n't think you can afford to pay for day to day live expense and a mortgage .
i would get another financial advisor who can help you .
someone should be able to lend you the money .
hi all , i currently have a mortgage which what use to be northern rock .
i take the mortgage out in 2007 , fix rate for 5 year .
this be due to finish in june .
i do n't know what to do !
i take the mortgage out with my then husband , we split two year ago .
he do all the money side of thing so have no idea where to go .
i have a funny feel that since house price have drop , i be likely to be in negative equity .
we borrow more than 100 % , retrospectively a stupid thing to do .
i have take the mortgage on on my own .
any advice would be gratefully receive , thank you .
in rate term , there 's nothing you can do .
if you be in negative equity as you seem to think , there be no prospect of another lender take you on , so a remortgage be n't go to be possible .
nram @/@ ukar which be the body manage your mortgage do not offer replacement or customer retention product , so your mortgage will revert to the follow @-@ on rate set out in your original key fact illustration ( kfi ) or mortgage offer .
this be likely to be the standard variable rate , currently 4.79 % .
given theat the current lend and borrow siatuion , it be more difficult for people to get a mortgage .
i understand that martgage broker be to be able to see from a lot of provider .
but for people be dififcult to get mortgage today , be their advise be worthy...
say for instance they say it be better you ask for this provider but in fact , when you afollow their suggestion , you get reject ?
be not that it be better to sticj to your bak who know wel your financial stability and ability ??
i undesratnd that some mortgage adviser be free of charge .
i be ask here because once you get reject it will seriously danage your credibility to get another lender ?
opinion and expereince from people in ths forum be really appreciated....
first of all i disagree that its hard to get a mortgage...compared to the day of 100 %+ mortgage yes but for the right applicant there be plenty of lend available .
obviously i be biased as i be an independant mortgage adviser but my view be it be good that we can source the whole market find the best deal and know the specific lend criteria of each lender .
i use to work for a bank and i would never offer my service to my friend and family as i do n't know whether there be better service elsewhere .
now i be comfortable do thing for my friend and family .
bank will want you to think that you have a better chance of get a mortgage with them as you have your finance with them but this be simply not true .
if you get reject you need to look into the reason why...affordability..credit score etc
hi my husband and i be look to buy the hosue we currently live in , but we do not have a deposit .
are there any 100 % mortgage out there and which one be the best to look at -
i be totally useless when it come to thing like this and hubby be no better ! !!
i currently earn about £21k a year and hubby earn just under £15k a year .
what be the likelyhood of us get a mortgage to start off with and be go to be more difficult to find 100 % one ?
any advice would be appreciate . thank
whats the value of your house ? ,
hows both your credit rate ?
this seem to be the 2 most important factor when consider a mortgage other than your joint income .
the chance of get a 100 % be probably impossible to be honest...
a share ownership property be one where you do not buy the property outright , but only a percentage share of the property . for example only 25 % .
however on the remain 75 % which be still own by the house association , you will pay a monthly rent .
so if you be not look at this type of property , you will not get a 100 % mortgage .
hello all - just join and after some advice .
i 've see the post on the forum relate to the nationwide consent to let and subsequent hike in interest rate by 1.5 % ( this be go back a year or two ) .
at the time my wife and i be rent out our property and have sign up to a 5 year fix rate mortgage .
we initially live in the property but subsequently let it out have receive permission to do so from nationwide .
given we be in a fix rate mortgage and have pay for the extra security i be pretty shock and appal that they be force this increase on us .
in any case my wife go to nationwide to discuss our option with the mortgage adviser .
the long and short of it be that the mortgage adviser give the advice that give base rate be 0.5 % and we could move to another lender on a formal btl mortgage for a far lower rate ( give with the 1.5 % increase our nationwide rate would be over 7 %) and therefore over a the mortgage term more than cover the early repayment fee .
this advice make perfect sense so we pay to come out of our fix rate with nationwide and move to another lender - the early repayment fee be circa £3k .
subsequently we receive the letter from nationwide ( as i be sure many do ) say that those on fix rate mortgage that would have to pay early redemption fee would not have the 1.5 % increase impose until the end of the term of the fix rate .
given the advice we receive and subsequent redemption fee we pay ( prior to nationwide change their mind ) i wonder whether anyone think we have any recourse against nationwide .
be very interested in any thought .
many thank
it definitely sound interesting .
i would certainly go to the branch , speak to someone in management and present this letter along with any documentary evidence that you may have have from your previous meet .
also get them to produce the note of your previous meet with the mortgage adviser .
we come within a gnat whisker of pay a 7k early redemption fee to avoid the 1.5 % hike .
thankfully the letter arrive a day before our completion date on our new mortgage so we be able to get out of it .
only 15 month until we can leave nationwide and move over to a proper btl mortgage .
are there any bridge company who 'll do a loan for an uninhabitable property ( it 's derelict )?
we need to borrow 55 % of the hammer price until we can get plan permission for restoration which will allow us to get a mortgage
( verbal approval of our plan have be give by the local plan officer and the build society in question ) .
( excuse me while i do a little - this be a build we nearly buy through normal channel 5 year ago , get gazump on and never think we 'd ever get another crack at it ! )
it do n't seem likely and would be horrendously expensive .
look at it from the lender 's point of view :
this be high risk - if you do n't get plan approval the site could actually be worth a negative amount ( due to demolition cost ) .
verbal approval be essentially worth nothing .
on the flip side there be little return for the lender as you do n't want the loan for long so not much time to charge interest .
really you would be better off : get a mortgage not a bridge loan ( also difficult ) . get an unsecured loan to buy it initially .
be aware that almost no bank or build society will give a mortgage on a property after it have be buy , if it be buy less than 6 month ago .
i do n't know the answer to your question , but it sound very risky to me .
you will be take on a costly short @-@ term loan based only on verbal promise which may not eventually come good .
what happen if the b soc do n't eventually make an offer , or it 's at a much lesser amount than you hope for ?
do it know that the house be uninhabitable - usually that make a property unmortgeable .
or if the pp take much long to be consider because there be objection / it 's refuse and you have to appeal etc ?
last time we get a thread like this , i suggest tiuta and the op do some research and find the cost be prohibitive .
i echo the other comment about how you deal with be unable to remortgage if something go wrong and would ask you to note you 'll have to stick with the bridge finance for around eight month as you won't be able to apply for the remortgage until you 've own the property for six .
caution need .
bridge be only possible where the lender believe you will live elsewhere .
they cannot lend on a property you will be live in as this then fall into fsa regulation , which bridge be exclude from .
an alternate to bridge be a non status mortgage , but the lender will still need to survey the property and carry out the nusual due dilligence to include full legal conveyancing and check .
the reason most aution deal be cash be that lend be never guarantee and can fall through at the mast moment , mean the applicant loose the property and thier 10 % deposit .
you 'll need a good deal of luck to get this through use lend .
also bridgers usualy want a clearly define exit route , and it wont be sufficient to say a remortgage should be possible subject to all manner of property repair ( what if you fall ill / go mad / get depress part way into the renovation for example ) .
hi all , current mortgage fix deal end in march and this will be the first time remortgaging .
purchase the property march 2009 .
the property be value at £102000 when we purchase it and we now owe £77000 .
i be interested in learn more about how valuation work when remortgaging .
do they come round ?
are there any way i can improve the potential result ?
what happen ?
nothing much have change since last valuation in or out the property .
to be honest i would be happy with £102000 valuation but guess we will find out .
any information anyone can provide about this process would be great .
are you remortgaging to a new lender , or do a product transfer with the current one ?
if it 's the latter , chance be your current lender will use a desktop system call hometrack .
if you be move your mortgage to a new lender , it will normally ask a surveyor to visit the property to establish its value .
as you be right on the 75 % borderline for the better product , i would imagine an inspection would be better for you .
talk to your current lender before you start shop around .
it 's be solve now .
thank for everyone
why on earth would you allow somebody else to sort out payslips and p60 for you ?
if you have proof of income why not provide it ?
you have be complicit in any fraudulent application by allow it to happen with full knowledge .
struggle to see how you could compain to the lender and cab when you apply fraudulently .
i suspect you be now register as a fraudulent applicant and will struggle to gain finance anywhere .
hi , i 've a dilema !
look to remortgage , and have find suitable product from yorkshire build society . £195 non @-@ refundable application fee , conveyancing and valuation free .
it be a 75 % ltv .
my house be worth very close to the 75 % mark .
if i apply , and the valuation come out lower , i 'd have to pick the next best product , which be actually santander .
santander value for free at £180000 , which be the amount we estimate it to be .
mortgage balance be £134000 , so as you can see , very close to the 75 % .
i could just go with santander ,
no fee , but would cost me additional £1700 over the 3 year fix term .
do i risk lose the £195?
i suppose only i can answer that , but any thought or tip ?
you appear to have do the maths and identify the pitfall .
if there 's no way of avoid that fee , you appear to have to risk it .
be n't there a product with no fee you could choose upto 75 % so you 'd lose nothing if the property be downvalued ?
lender i have speak to say that while their valuation fee be ' free ', you still have to pay for it but it be refund if you go ahead .
i guess it 's not always the case ( only speak to 2 lender , and perhaps i only discuss it with one of them ) .
it 's one of the reason why i 'm not remortgaging at the moment - found a great 80 % rate but could go the wrong way of the house be value lower than expect .
just to also say , ybs be quite strict on affordability too not just ltv ,
their online affordability calculator be quite close .
santander be not as strict .
good even people ,
was look for a little advise in regard to the possible mis @-@ sell by a mortgage broker of a 100 % intrest only mortgage .
my partner sign up for a 100 % intrest only mortgage with the nothern rock mortgage but to realise it be a intrest only mortgage some 5 year down the line .
the reason i feel that may have a case to be answer be that surely mortgage company must take some precaution when sell an intrest only mortgage
i.e the customer must take out some sort of endowment to ensure that when the mortgage intrest be finally pay off then the customer would be in a financial position to pay of the actual amount the mortgage be agree for ? ??
the mortgage broker who advise obviously have a case to answer but be nothern rock in the wrong aswell ?
any information that can be offer would be greatly appreciate .
no , there be not .
read the paperwork she get when she take out the mortgage - it will explain that you need to set up a repayment vehicle for the capital amount .
i would also be amaze if the broker do not also advise her of this .
unfortunately this be quite a common problem , particularly with young first time buyer who have no real clue about mortgage .
this be a problem during the boom year in that bank be not check if customer have a repayment vehicle in place , hence they be throw these interest only mortgage at people because that 's all they could afford because house price be so high .
there be people on here who will deny this ever take place .
many people put a lot of faith in some of these broker in the belief that they be act in their best interest .
unfortunately there be probably little come back because ultimately your partner should have read closely what she be get into before she sign .
i know that might sound callous but there be the say that cover this which be ' buyer beware '.
where do we go from here ?
some stock have have a great run since early march
be it time to cash in and wait for the next drop or have we bottomed and its a steady rise from here ?
i would like to here from anyone who see the last recession , late eighty , pan out and how the sector react .
i view chart from then ,
it show volatility till ' 92 before a general steady rise although different sector behave differently
any thought appreciate
quote : agree with purchy .
i think we 'll be rangebound for quite a few year .
except there be a good chance that commodity and commodity stock will spike violently upwards for a while in a year or so ( higher than they be in 2008 ) , thank to supply destruction which may well have a coil spring effect .
also inflation and a fall dollar should help them go up as well..
there be also good reason to believe that commodity will rise over the long terma s well .
hi , 1 st time post so please bear with me !
i be due to receive approx 20k from sale of decease parental home and need to find somewhere to put it .
have use up my isa allowance ( so have hubby ) may need to access all our fund within the next 12 month as we will either be move home or do self build if nothing suitable come on market .
therefore need to be able to access fund without too much penalty/notice .
have 2 kid and wonder if i could put money in children account for better tax free interest or do you have any suggestion please ?
thank in advance for any help
based on what you have say , you should not invest but stick to savings .
check out the usual table on this site for interest rate .
if you put money into the name of your child it become his beneficially .
in any case see http : //www.hmrc.gov.uk/tdsi/children.htm for tax treatment of interest on money give to children by parent .
you could always hold the cash in an on @-@ line account ( aa pay 3.2 % gross ) until april
then each of you can put £5640 into a cash isa ?
hi an elderly relative ( late 80 s life in annex adjoin the house ) have bank with lloyds all her life - and she ask me for some general advice .
i wasnt at all familiar with her financial situation and she have in the past been advise by lloyds .
what appear to be the case be that she have : £150k+ in an oeic @/@ share isa with scottish widow £30k in easy access savings account pay 2 % with lloyds £15k in current account with lloyds £5k in cash isa with lloyds
what struck me be that she have all her savings in lloyds @/@ scottish widow so well over the £85k protection limit .
also that she have be advise to put so much in oeic @/@ corporate bonds/shares isas as it appear her capital have be fluctuate ( generally down ) .
she invest this whilst in her 80 s so am struggle to see how it would be good advice to ask her to put so much in a scheme where capital be not protect .
anyhow we have book an appointment next week to go through this with me in support .
do others think this advice be strange ?
and what would others advise .
my instinct be to get her into good savings account where capital be not at risk and to split it across 3 different institution ( it seem you can can get 3 %+ if you keep an eye on the rate be offer ) , plus make sure she use all the isa allowance each year
any thought @/@ comment would be appreciate ? david
i 'd be reluctant to start mess with an elderly relative 's finance .
others in the family might accuse you of all sort when she die .
that say : 1 ) if she 's of sound mind you need to understand if she 's prepare to move from ltsb or not .
another bank may confuse her significantly .
2 ) if she want to stay with ltsb , support her in find the best home for her money from their range , but also help her to keep it in a good pay account , as most of their account have 12 month bonus .
3 ) make sure you do n't do anything with cash isa that could impact her stock and share isa .
4 ) get her agreement to shift money from the current account to a better savings account ( even if it 's only the 2 % one ) .
just because somebody 's old do n't mean that capital should be protect .
my big concern for her would be if she own a property .
there 's a high chance of an iht bill on the horizon .
i 'd be talk to an ifa about the best way to mitigate this .
as dunstonh suggest , the share will effectively be in her name and be n't relevant to the protection scheme .
this be a very tough one .
bank generally will do what 's best for them which be invariably bad for the customer .
there be a lot of evidence these be some of the worst route to market due to them often have the highest cost .
as mention though , change be never fun , especially when it could be confuse and misunderstood .
i would personally say she should find an ifa and pay upfront for advice ( ie no commission ) so she get what be most suitable for her .
given her age it 's standard practice to have less money in equity and more in guarantee income than she currently appear to have due to short term fluctuation .
i 'm probably go to get criticize for what i 'm about to write , but as a long time lurker on these forum i know that i can also expect some sensible and honest opinion .
i have be have a relationship with a married man for some time now and i 'm start to get feed up with the situation and wonder if this be all it 's ever go to be .
how likely be it that a married man would leave his wife for the ' other woman ', how do i know if he 's serious about me or just toying with me ?
i know he do love me , but that 's not always enough be it ?
i be really tear at the moment whether to let thing carry on , or to walk away .
likelihood of him leave his wife for you , slim to none .
even if he do could you live your life happily ?
if he can do it to his wife , would he have qualm about do it to his girlfriend ?
1. the person you be have the affair with be cheat on his wife .
if he do it once , he could do it again - remember the old say " when a man marry his mistress , it leave a vacancy - for the next mistress ".
2. quite simply , he be cheat , you be cheat .
there be all the excuse in the world " he will leave when the children be older @/@ when his wife be better @/@ when they 've sort out finance - just wait for the right time to tell her " blah , blah blah , blah !
if you have any integrety , you would walk away now .
are you in a relationship with anybody ? or be you single
he 's have his cake and eat it at the moment ?
why would he want to give that up ?
i 'm struggle for idea as to what to do for my birthday this week .
dh will be at work , ds at school and dd at nursery till 12 pm unless i choose to take her out for the day so i can go somwhere till 3.15pm .
in some way i envy my dh who have a july birthday that generally fall within school holiday and we be all around him with good weather .
on mine its generally dull , rain or cold and everyone be work .
this year i 've thougth and think about what i can do either on my own or maybe with my almost 4 year old .
my mum suggest i go over with her to visit my dad who 's on a house sit and have a sandwich with them at lunchtime and open my pressie .
this seem to be my best option but its not what i would choose to do or really want to do .
my parent have choose to do this house sit , i really dont mind but i 'm not sure i want to go over , walk the dog and sit in a stranger house for a couple of hour to pass the time .
any thought please on what you grow up do for january birthday when the weather be rubbish and your friend be work .
i dont expect to be entertain and happy to potter around or go to a national trust/swimming , but my local pool doens't have an open swim on thurs suitable for my availability and i do n't have a car free to drive .
hmmmm....... its quandry !
chalk it up to one those thing that happen when you have kid and do something at the weekend instead .
mine be on the 13 th .
( eta : have i have the money , i would have go off for a couple of hour and a coffee at the nicest garden centre near to where i live so i could get there by bus )
go for a meal with your dh in the even after his work , and get your parent to babysit ?
day time wise - how much money do you want to spend ?
get your nail @/@ hair etc done ?
depends what youre in to .
i dont normally do anything in the day time for my bday ,
id do something at the nearest weekend or that night .
i 'm try to muster some sympathy for you but i 'm sorry i really can n't .
my birthday be in january too , and most year i have to work . for the whole day ! !!!
this year , i work all day , could n't celebrate with my dd because she be work in the even , so i go out for a bite to eat with a couple of friend and then on to see a film .
i 'll celebrate my birthday with my dd when we both have some time together... in february .
your parent want to see you and spend some time with you , give you a present so be gracious ( and a bit mature ) and go !
hi , i be get marry on february 18 th 2012 and i be plan on buy a gift for my wife to be .
she love tiffany and i buy her the chunky link bracelet with heart in the first few month that we be together so now i be think to get her the necklace .
be the official tiffany uk website the only place to buy official and not fake item or be there other place that sell tiffany ?
plus anyone else have any other similar idea ? ?
look at link of london and pandora but i 'm not sure....
sound lovely .
the only place to buy genuine tiffany be the website or tiffany shop .
the only place to get tiffany cheaper be the airport shop abroad , if the exchange rate/ duty free combination work in your favour .
have the match necklace be a lovely idea .
if she like charm you could get the link sweetie bracelet - then you have the next few present sort out for the charm .
oh come home from work on monday even by taxi and find 3 men try to break into the house .
they set upon him , knock him to the floor and kick him several time in head and stomach , stole his mobile phone and bag and run off .
the police come out very quickly , do a drive around with oh and the cabby but do n't see them that night .
they take dh 's bag ( which they find dump a few street away ) and say they would forensically test it , and there be a cctv camera which cover the area and the cabby say he could definitely identify the men as he get a clear view .
dh have not be ask to give a statement , and we assume nor have the cabby .
he get a letter in the post this morning , date tuesday , say the police be close their investigation .
the detective in charge have n't answer phone call and his bag have n't be return to him , which contain business paper and clothe .
dh do need treatment at a and e after the attack
it seem pretty clear that the police do not bother with forensic test and may not even have check the cctv footage .
be there anything which can be do to challenge their decision not even to do a preliminary investigation into an attempt burglary and common assault , where there be witness to the attack ?
if it be relevant at all , dh have no previous conviction , arrest or anything similar with the police , and be a middle aged businessman set upon by 20 year old male of a different racial background to us .
no , something be wrong here .
they can n't just ' close an investigation ' the day afterwards , not have even take statement .
i 'd say get some legal advice , or write to the police , state what you 've put in your post above and ask for an explanation .
you could try post this on the moneysaving in marriage and relationship board ?
you might get more answer there .
i would get down to the police station soon than just write a letter .
if cctv need to be examine and have not yet be look at , you want it seize asap , before it be record over .
it be of course possible that the cctv be n't work on the day in question but i be still surprise no other forensic examination have take place .
if a full note of your oh 's / the cabby 's evidence be take in a police notebook then the need for an immediate witness statement be reduce .
if this be really true , start here : http : //www.ipcc.gov.uk/en/pages/default.aspx
but ! be prepare to be stop for motor offence by disgruntle copper for the next 10 or so years........
make a formal complaint .

i 'm actually v excite as it all seem like fun , but all ex leader be v cynical ?
i think as with everything from read this thread there 's always the politics and the ooo could you just do a bit more for us aspect , we 'll have to keep our mouth firmly zip .
i 'm look to try to start volunteer sometime in the near future and be a rainbow/brownie/guide when younger and think i might enjoy help out but have no idea how to make the first step to get involve
hi all i be look for advice please .
dd1 be in futher education -
because the course she want to do be n't available near us she be in residential college and we pay her accommodation and food cost ,
it leave thing very tight , but as we feel this be a great opportunity for her we be prepare to do it .
she also have the use of a car as its easier ( and a lot cheap ) than us drive her back and forth most week .
dd2 be due to leave school next summer and be hope to start a hairdressing apprenticeship .
she start to talk about drive lesson ( a bit premature i know ) and us buy a car and pay for petrol and insurance .
i mention to her that as she will be earn an income it will be time for her to start pay us towards her keep , etc.
she think that will be very unfair as we be still pay for her older sister .
any suggestion please - we be prepare to take the money and put it away for her future ( although i would n't admit that to her as she would want it sooner rather than later ) .
i do see her point , but be not prepare to let her get away with not pay anything .
thank for read .
do her sister earn any money ?
if she do n't , then you could speak to them both about the contribution you expect from them when they both start earn .
as for the car - did you pay for dd1s lesson ?
it seem unfair to not pay for dd2s if you do , and then to allow access to the car .
i do n't see why she would expect her own car if her sister share yours , although you will have to think about priority for who need the car and what you will do if both want the car !
let her get away without pay anything won't teach her anything for the future , but equally if she does't get the same treatment as her sister she 'll probably feel quite upset .
my grandaughter be in the final year of 3 of a hairdressing course ,
she have to work part @-@ time in a salon but do n't earn very much and the stuff she have have to buy @/@ keep replacing for the course have be very expensive.. so my daughter have have to help her by not actually take any keep money as long as she be on the course..
its meant my grandaughter have manage to pay for all her own clothe , fare , lunch , and go out money over the course..
my daughter be happy that she 'd find something she want to do and be able to near enough support herself through it..
as i say at the begin as an apprentice she will be earn peanuts..
i agree with what be be say tw .
to support dd1 to the tune that you be and then to expect dd2 to pay into the household on what i 'm sure will be a much less than minimum wage apprenticeship seem like a double blow to dd2 to me ! and i can appreciate her frustration .
i do think that whilst dd2 be do her apprenticeship she should be allow to retain her wage .
you should explain to her that this be your way of ensure that they be both treat equally in what be very different circumstance .
however i would also make clear that once either of them begin to earn a full time wage outside of college or apprenticeship that they will be expect to contribute to the house if they continue to live there !
i wish you well .
i 'm sorry but i can see your dd2 's point -
you say you would support her if she go to college but even though you agree that the apprenticeship would be a better career choice you 're prepare to penalise her for it .
if she be leave school to get a normal job i would agree she should contribute but this be basically her still study , just go about it in a slightly less conventional way .
have she arrange to apply for this herself ?
that to me show a lot of intitative and motivation for someone her age ,
rather then take the more mainstream option of college she have look into her option and gone for what will be best for her future career .
apprentice wage be extremely low so while she be on those could you maybe look at a compromise -
eg you will still provide her room and board ( the same as you be do for her sister ) but she have to pay all her expense out of her wage , ie her travel to work , lunch there if she need them , phone if she have it , any expense she need for work .
hmmmmmm hard one here !
normally i would say yes , take a nominal amount from your dd2 as she be now " work ", but as you be support dd1 , i can see why she might be cheesed off .
i guess it depends on how much she be earn during her first year as an apprentice......
let say , for talk sake , it 's £100 a week ,
that 's still a lot of money for a school leaver who have no household expense or food to pay .
personally i would take a small amount , say £20 a week from her and , as you say , put it in a savings account for if she do decide to go travel in the future .
explain to here that it may not seem fair , but she be now earn , and the cost of this compare to live away from home , be minimal . or show her a breakdown of what a 1 @/@ 3 of all household cost would be .
in regard to the car , do your dd1 really need one ?
of course it be easier for her to get home at weekend , but can she not get the train / bus ?
when i be at uni , i think i could count the number of student who live away from home and have a car on one hand - the rest mnade do with a young person railcard .
and will your dd2 need a car ?
if the answer if no , neither of them really need it then i would suggest that they share the car ( 1 month on / off , for example ) .
a car for a teenager / student , be an expensive luxury and with the rise cost of insurance and fuel , most parent cannot this for one child , let alone 2 .
if that be the case , after the child be born , the father will go to the mother 's home , and present the family matriarch with gift , ask to be accept as the father .

i remember my first year study at qinghua , i go to my first elective course call " inspiration in the history of physic . "
there be only ten or so of us who have choose it that semester .
the teacher be very erudite , his lecture be very lively ; he summarize all of the recent and contemporary history of physic , and each time i be enthral .
in all my five year at the university , i never have another course that interesting .
if i be to summarize this course , it would be : the greatest discovery in physic all have their own necessity and theoretical basis ( for example , the development of mathematics ) .
this theory can also be apply to cook .
one day i want to make green bean and bean curd sheet ( dry tofu in the northeast ) .
here the dry tofu sell in the store be all compress , very tough .
so i normally steep it in hot water , then take it out and stir - fry it .
because that day i need to go out in the middle of it and buy some thing , i set the timer and tell my wife to turn off the heat when it be do .
my wife be very lazy , and when the timer sound , she turn off the heat and leave the pot sit on the stove .
when i come back and look , the dried tofu be white and soft , just like freshly make .
chalk another good one up to the wife .
guo kai 's economic note : your uncle be just your uncle .
guo kai 's economic note
this morning i go to the supermarket with dad , and when it come time to check out i discover something that everybody probably know : not everybody buy the same thing .
of course this be a no - brainer , but this be actually a major problem face by me and many other people whenever we discuss economic issue or economic phenomena .
most of the time , economic policy and economic theory be not aim at individual .
in term of probability , if you explain the behavior of a specific individual , for example your uncle , use any economic theory , the probability that it will be accurate be virtually 0 .
in fact , in the great majority of case the economic theory be aim at an entire group , or a subgroup .
in term of average , accuracy be the goal of many economic theory ( here i 'm be inaccurate ; i hope the expert will not take it too literally , especially those with io expertise ) .
but with regard to an ordinary person , he may never see the whole group , he see only his co @-@ worker , his relative and his friend , the group of people familiar to him ; add up all the people in this group and they may number 200 , and that be already a lot of people .
below i be go to refer to these 200 people collectively as " his uncle . "
so whenever you discuss an economic theory with someone , the response of a perfectly ordinary person would be : my uncle be n't like that , so this theory be baloney .
in other word , everybody tend to mistake the part for the whole .
here , mistake the part for the whole be not derogatory ; it be a limitation of the human race itself ; you have it and i have it .
if americans have learn not to mistake the part for the whole , they might not have make such a mess of the world .
i believe that they make such a complete mess of the middle east to a very large extent because they apply their own common sense to understand the middle east , which be a completely different place from the unite state .
on this issue , china do not have much basis for be self - congratulatory ; china 's rapid rise have even cause some people to have a sort of misconception - that whatever china do be right - and this be in fact a manifestation of narrow - mindedness .
therefore i believe it be extremely important to recognize that one 's own knowledge have limitation .
we need to maintain a sufficiently open attitude toward thing that do n't correspond to our common sense .
so just because every time your uncle go to the supermarket he buy hog head meat do n't mean that we should immediately assume that any theory that do not predict people go to the supermarket will buy hog head meat be wrong .
when you feel other people be talk baloney , and what other people say do not correspond to your " common sense , " you should at the same time recognize that your uncle be only your uncle , he be not the whole world .
well , gasoline in richmond have have hit $ 3.00 a gallon , or just shy of it ,
and i spend $ 48 fill up the gas tank of my jeep --
the most i 've ever pay for in my life .
i 'm not happy about it ,
but i do n't see high gas price as a reason to start foam at the mouth and chew on the carpet .
others feel less constrain .
the hysteria over rise gas price have reach a fever pitch .
the economic ignorance of the sound bite and commentary i 've see on national television know no bound .
demagogue be call for self - destructive tax on oil company profit , oblivious to the reality that , in a capitalist society , profit be a critical signal that guide the flow of capital .
( 1 ) if you confiscate exxon mobil 's profit , you reduce the capital available to the world 's largest oil company to invest in more exploratory drill , new oil well , new pipeline , new refinery , etc.
( 2 ) if you tax oil industry profit , you also reduce the incentive for owner of outside capital to invest in new capacity .
why bother if the profit will be tax away ?
here in virginia , a semblance of sanity still reign .
gov. timothy m. kaine have not yet propose anything as breath - takingly stupid as the proposal emanating from washington , d.c. .
the governor have say he will investigate report of `` price gouge , '' which , give the fact that the the concept of `` price gouge '' be meaningless and impossible to define , mean he will , for all practical purpose , do nothing ....
which be exactly what he should do .
nothing .
virginians and americans will adapt to higher gas price if government do not interfere .
( the governor also be consider apply for a waiver of federal regulation require cleaner gasoline be sell in virginia 's major metro area , but have not yet make a determination .
see the time - dispatch report .
unfortunately , he 's stick to his gun on try to raise $ 1 billion for transportation project without raise gasoline tax -- a topic for another post .
as i have be hammer away relentlessly on this blog ( see `` a world with one billion car '' ) , the world economy be move from a 20 - year era of cheap petroleum to a plateau of more expensive petroleum .
this shift be drive by the combination of ( a ) escalate world consumption of petroleum , especially in rapidly develop economy like china and india , and ( b ) the peak of global oil production capacity , the increase expense of exploit the remote and isolate oil reserve that remain , and terrorist / political instability in oil - produce country .
this be not the oil company ' fault .
this be not dick cheney 's fault .
this be not the auto industry ' fault .
it be not the environmentalist ' fault .
it 's the reality of geology and geopolitics .
the american public can adapt to the new global reality by change their energy - intensive lifestyles ,
and politician can help them by speak honestly and forthrightly about why the price of gasoline be increase , instead of demagoguing the issue for short - term political gain .
here in virginia , the general assembly have be examine what virginia can do to increase energy production .
that be ok , as far as it go .
but there be nothing that virginia can do to increase the global supply of oil , and probably little it can do to increase the petroleum refine capacity need to convert oil to gasoline .
what the political and business leadership of virginia have so far fail utterly to do be admit that virginia be acutely vulnerable to oil price shock .
virginians consume more gasoline per capita than the national average , in part because our transportation policy be gear toward matching every increase in automobile travel with an increase in transportation capacity with no thought of modulate travel demand .
but reality be a stubborn thing .
with each increase in the price of gasoline , the bankruptcy of the old order become increasingly evident .
let us hope that gov. kaine , who pride himself on straight talk , begin leveling with the people of virginia .
jim - you be right on the money about how capitalism work ,
so why not try to make capitalism really work for virginia .
the future in transportation belong to the nation , company or person who develop the alternative to gasoline power automobile .
why not do everything we can to assure that future arise from virginia ?
rather than drill for oil and gas off the atlantic coast , we should be offer enormous incentive for comapnies and individual who want to work on alternative fuel solution to locate their business here .
you can encourage r&d on alternative fuel with grant and tax break .
and , you can work to increase supply .
the one and only oil refinery in the commonwealth be nearby in yorktown .
they could double their capacity without leave the premise .
why have n't the company apply to do builf new facility on site ?
by all mean explore for oil and gas in the atlantic .
jim : speak seriously here , many family ( include my own ) have already cut back in every way possible .
what then ?
my office , home and children 's school be all within a 6 mile radius .
vacation be already a thing of the past .
we 've cut back on grocery .
i 'd trade the car on a hybrid ,
but it 's pay for
and who can afford a car payment what with mortgage rate be what they be and three kid ...
so , i ask seriously , what be average hard - work family to do ?
andrea : how about a couple of hundred dollar ?
if the ga repeal the unnecessary sale tax from last year , then the average citizen would pick up some cash .
or , the ga could actually cut the sale tax
and you would keep some more of your money .
check out how much the republican senator want you to pay in other , new tax too - to register your car , etc.
jim : i like the graphic ,
it take two arm and two leg to fill up our tank .
the only answer to cut the cost of mobility and access be settlement pattern that require less vehicle travel and support more effecient share - vehicle when one must resort to any vehicle .
that be what an understand of jane jacobs suggest 40 year ago ( not just in `` life and death ... but also `` the economy of ' city ' . ''
let us , honor ms. jacobs 's memory with an understand of the need for fundamental change .
emr
jab - got ta love it .
yup , a couple of hundred dollar be go to save the day !
jane jacobs know the difference between a community and a construction plan .
was n't one of her main argument that you can not plan everything , and you should allow community to be what they be and what they become ?
did n't she fight robert moses because he think he have too much control over other people ' life ?
somehow i doubt she would have get on board with fundamental change if it involve massive central and regional plan .
andrea , one option may be telecommuting a couple of day a week .
other than that , here 's the hard truth :
there 's not much that average , hard - work family can do in the short run to cope with higher gas price except hope that their paychecks keep pace with inflation .
what you should not do be support demagogic political ploy that make problem worse , not better .
in the long run , you can support more pedestrian friendly , transit - friendly development pattern that give you and your family more transportation option .
you should support development pattern that allow compatible use ( house , small office building , small retail shop ) to be locate close to each rather than scatter all over .
how much money could you save if you could get by with only one car instead of two ?
what would it mean if you live in a place where your children could walk to school ?
think outside the box .
kingfish , i 'm all in favor of alternate fuel .
convert biomass to ethanol seem to be one that be self - sustain economically without massive incentive .
i 'd favor government - sponsor research to devise technology that would make ethanol more competitive ,
but i do n't like the idea of subsidize specific business enterprise .
once you give them a subsidy , they never let go , no matter how much the world change around them .
witness the mohair subsidy put into place during world war ii .
i tend to agree with jim that market function best , so long as no one have a finger on the scale .
many believe that zone price , which be generally use by oil company , be inconsistent with our antitrust law ( section 13 of the robinson - patman act ) .
others disagree .
do zone price constitute a finger on the scale ?
if so , should the ga outlaw zone price ?
toomanytaxes : zone price be the mechanism the oil company use to make sure that we pay the same price as people in state with higher gas tax .
only , we pay the extra few cent per gallon to them rather than into our state transportation account .
consider the wide variety in local and state fuel tax the near uniformity of the pump price across state line be ... curious .
i be recently on the webpage for the energy information agency
and their cost of fuel adjust for inflation chart demonstates that we have be at $ 3 per gallon measure in 2005 dollar before .
it be about the historic peak in real price ,
but it be hardly unprecedented , and not worth quite the hype or hysteria it be generate .
it be hard to imagine a company or a family that can not improve its efficiency and reduce consumption ,
and that be not a bad outcome at all .
like you , jim , i see the bright silver line .
i seem to be get more question whenever i pull up in my hybrid .
one data point .
2 @:@ 53 why be gas price often significantly different for the same brand between prince william and fairfax county and even at different location within the same county ?
zone price be try to do much more than reflect different tax rate .
take a look at the following link : http : //www.gasbuddy.com/gb_gastemperaturemap.aspx
assume the general accuracy of the data underlie the map ,
difference in do not explain zone price .
look at arizona , for example .
there be much higher transportation cost in and around the grand canyon and much more competition in the phoenix market .
yet , phoenix price tend to be signficantly higher .
ditto for tax .
from what i quickly find on the internet , total fuel tax for the follow four state be va ( 37.7 cent ) ; utah ( 42.5 cent ) ; nc ( 45.6 cent ) and montana ( 46.2 cent ) .
however , both montana and utah have average price that be significantly lower than either va or nc .
there 's probably less relationship to cost and zone price than the oil company want the public to believe .
i have a conversation with a friend the other day who own an suv
and he be n't worry about the price of gas because he travel less than 10 mile a day ..
yes ..
it 'll cost more ...
so he 'll have to cut back on his gourmet coffee ... two cup rather than three . :-)
seriously - it 's about how far folk choose to drive and how folk define phrase like `` i must and have no choice '' .
it take a hard knock for folk to take a hard look at thing they always assume could not change .
i predict ... lot of folk will be take harder look at whether or not choice be choice or no choice '' be truly no choice .
i know it happen during the gas crisis ...
and as bad as it be now - this be not as bad as then - though if $ 3 a gallon be in the rear view mirror and $ 4 a gallon on the horizon and come fast ... we might think so ...
.. but i would bet that folk would choose ( there 's that word again ) $ 4 or even $ 5 a gallon rather than wait in line for 3 hour only to find out the guy in front of you get the last tankful .
america 's love affair with the automobile be about to be revisted though i doubt seriously a divorce be anywhere near ... :-)
sorry .. my attitude be grin and bear it ...
it 's sort of like coffee double in price ...
my property accessment go up 300 % ( which it do ) ...
... and today .. i pay $ 68 buck to fill up my 89 ford van .
i get ta talk to ray hyde about that hybrid .... he 's get ..
he say if he have to choose .. he 'd keep his truck ... :-)
did i really say that ?
that would be a tough `` choice '' .
with the truck i 'd have some chance of make money ,
but i 'd hate to have to drive it if it be n't work .
if you have to drive , the hybrid be a joy .
dead silent , dirt cheap , reliable , little bit of capital cost detriment , sufficient power .
48 mpg if you drive at 75+ like a maniac .
i remember people sniff at it , say they would n't do it because the payback on capital be n't there .
i drone on about cost and benefit , but a ) that 's not everything , and b ) sometimes circumstance change .
i 'm go to have to send a letter to the guv'nor .
i have a bunch of vehicle and only use the appropriate one for the task at hand .
i need a portable license plate and insurance , otherwise the current `` tax '' plan be go to kill me .
i sure hope that those of you who think save open space and farm will chip in and help out on this :
send a letter .
i do n't mind pay what it cost to drive or pay what i owe ,
but this be go to be whack .
i suspect that overhead cost might have something to do with fuel price .
that gas station in fairfax be sit on expensive land and pay high tax .
business be `` tax positive '' do n't cha know .
if people really do start make different choice , it 's go to be fun to watch real estate price .
btw 13 % more new home sale last year , in spite of higher rate ,
but price be down 5k .
time to demand another reassessment .
ray hyde : tax be indeed business overhead that affect retail price .
but i still suggest that zone price have more to do with computer software and data - mine than actual cost .

if you 're arlington county , you create a new vision for the boxy building and subterranean passageway in crystal city that will be empty by the federal base realignment and closure commission .
in place of the sterile monoculture that now characterize the office complex near the pentagon , member of an advisory task force see a more lively street - level scene with a greater mix of shop , restaurant and office .
write wapo reporter annie gowen :
[ board of supervisor chairman chris ] zimmerman and others speak yesterday say that the vounty see the empty space as an opportunity to `` reimagine '' and `` brand '' crystal city as an attractive destination .
though close to reagan national airport and dense with hotel , the area have long be see as a gloomy 1960 s era enclave of office connect by underground passage .
but part of crystal city have lately see a rebirth , thank to an influx of trendy cafe and a new streetscape ....
charles e. smith commercial realty , which own 7.4 million of the 11 million square feet of office space in the neighborhood , have spend $ 40 million on improvement to enliven the street and attract new business .
it turn crystal drive into a two - way main street and have recruit new shop and chic restaurant such as jaleo and mccormick & schmick 's .
read between the line of gowen 's story , however , there seem to be one big miss piece :
house .
create a livelier commercial district be a worthy goal .
but create a balanced community with a mix of house , office , shop and other amenity -- allow people to live close to where they work and play -- be an even more worthy goal .
as ed risse have point out , the relocation of 17,000 job create a rare opportunity to create a genuine balance community in northern virginia .
the problem , i surmise -- it 's not discuss in the story -- be that arlington be concern about protect its tax base , which mean replace the vacated office with new office , not house .
it 's hard to fault arlington for pursue its short - term self interest .
but everyone need to recognize that arlington 's decision not to pursue a balanced community mean that house will end up somewhere else , presumably in outlying county .
and employee work in the buff up crystal city will wind up commute long distance and clog northern virginia thoroughfare .
so i work in that same beauty salon ,
i 'm chain to the old masquerade
the lipstick , the shadow , the silicone :
i follow my father 's trade -

michael jackson may be another example of a celebrity distraction which , upon examination , reveal more about our society 's mortal condition than a tabloid could imagine .
almost certainly more than it would dare to describe .
yesterday , jackson be order to close neverland for have fail to pay the ranch 's 47 employee their salary or insurance since the end of 2005 .
unfortunate for the unpaid staff and the abandon llama but no surprise .
he 's move on since his aquittal , like gary glitter do after his 1999 conviction , have depart last june for a bahrain `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
( '' for the people work at bahrain 's mall , the person cover head to toe in a black veil , glove and glass appear to be a rich , doting saudi mother ....
but why would a woman wear a man 's shoe ?
why the bodyguard ?
and why do the person 's fluid movement seem so familiar ? '' )
last week 's real jackson story run in the new york daily news , under the snappy banner `` creepy dad be root of all clan 's woe , singer sez . ''
the singer be brother jermaine , and the claim based on the project outline for his abandon `` tell - all '' family story .
read that joseph be a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards his daughter be not exactly a `` stop the press '' moment .
what 's new be this :
jermaine even suggest his father may have set up michael to be somehow victimize by older men .
he tell how his father would have michael join in at late - night hotel room meeting with `` important business people , '' and wonder whether `` something happen '' to michael at those session .
he say he sense something be wrong because michael would be sick for day after .
`` what be joseph do ? '' jermaine write .
this lift the jackson family horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction , one that see parent network with power and trade their children for privilege .
this should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivor : the father and first controller , pass his child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status , protection and reward .
or maybe not : `` latoya also describe be awaken in the night by joseph wear a ' monster mask . ' ''
perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the jackson clan have get with the program .
perhaps rather the point be that the program exploit pre @-@ exist condition for abuse which be more common than most suspect .
( this be how i tend to think of ponchatoula 's hosanna church . )
yet we should n't discount the suspicion , either , particularly give some of michael 's paranormal interest and peculiar association .
his close friendship with spectra contactee and channeller of the nine , uri geller , for one instance .
( jackson be geller 's best man in 2001 when he and his wife renew his vow , the same year geller be say to have be reactivate as a psychic spy . )
his entourage include a `` personal magician '' for another .
even if you want to , you wo n't be read jermaine 's account now .
like every jackson sibling who 's try to break from joe , he 's climb down , return to the fold and scrap the book , apparently on the strength of michael 's threat to sue .
previously , michael 's give cause for family observer to attribute his grotesque body dysmorphia to a dread of resemble his father .
yet there they be at jackson 's trial last year , hand in hand .
but his little picture may be more newsworthy than the news suggest .
good stuff .
have depart last june for a bahrain `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
actually , there have be report for the past two day of jackson back in california .
#name ?
wild wild stuff jeff !
disinformation distraction dis and dat ..
bait and switch set the agenda .
there be no such thing as an accident .
it 's saturday morning , and the paper say a moon of saturn be spew life - give water .... then i see the new r.i. post be about the perrenial child michael jackson .
this day be name for saturn ...
" ... it be foretell that one day a mighty son of saturn would in turn overthrow him ,
and saturn devour all of his children when they be born to prevent this ... ''
apparently saturn be also intimately connect with satan , masonic , and revelation 13 - you know , the `` number of the beast '' ...
nevermind -
i need a cup of coffee ...
i look in vain for the cheney `` a hunt we will go '' to post this out and paste but ...
and on the subject of cowardice , consider this . in a recent hunt escapade , dick cheney accidentally shoot one of his hunt comrade .
there may have be negligence involve , but that be up to the local district attorney to decide .
but more importantly , i think , be the nature of the hunt .
these be not wild bird .
the bird be breed in captivity .
they have spend their life in pen , and then on hunt day , be release for the sole purpose of be kill by dick cheney and cohort for pure sport as they fly into the open sky for their only moment of brief freedom .
the link `` personal majician '' be intrigueing .
from madsen via boucher :
jackson 's stay at the cedar be arrange through david kuo , george w. bush 's white house director of the office of faith - based initiative .
kuo also previously work for the christian coalition and senator john ashcroft .
there 's also some curious neverland / disneyland connection to the `` mickey mouse club '' children who be now star , include justin timberlake ( remember the star on janet jackson 's breast ? ) and brittany spear , christina aguilera ...
the piper walk into the mountain , still follow by the children , and the cave close again ...
here be boucher 's follow up to the `` majician '' link of jeff 's .
but i think you might cover chile 's inauguration of its first woman president today instead ...
maybe later as the story develop ?
jeff boucher 's piece mention how victim of sexual abuse often have childlike voice , almost as if their development be ' freeze ' around the time of their abuse .
jackson seem to be of this type .
or more perversely , fake that he be :
`` i be always say [ to jackson ] people would n't think i be so crazy if they see who the hell you really be , that you sit around , and you drink and you curse and you 're [ expletive ] funny and you have a bad mouth , and you do n't have that high voice all the time '' -
lisa marie presley , in an interview quote in a wapo article write by tina brown :
michael jackson 's false front ?
`` david geffen , be go !
steven spielberg , be go ! ''
the witch doctor curse michael jackson 's enemy and bless the tarnished king of pop himself in a voodoo ritual in switzerland in the summer of 2000 have promise that the 25 people on jackson 's enemy list ( would soon be dead ) ...
jackson have order his then business adviser , myung - ho lee , a u.s. - educate korean lawyer based in seoul , to wire $ 150,000 to a bank in mali for a voodoo chief name baba , who then have 42 cow ritually sacrifice for the ceremony .
jackson have already undergo a blood bath ...
the pop star , who be say to be $ 240 million in debt , have pay six figure for a ritual cleanse use sheep blood to another voodoo doctor and a mysterious egyptian woman name samia , who come to him with a letter of greet from a high - rank saudi prince , purportedly nawaf bin abdulaziz al - saud , now the chief of intelligence of saudi arabia ...
http : //www.vanityfair.com/commentary/content/articles/050411roco03c hmm .
accord to that vanity fair article , jacko and uri geller meet through `` that other fellow devotee of children 's charity mohamed fayed , the chairman of harrods in london , who believe that the c.i.a. and prince philip have princess diana and his son , dodi , kill . ''
anonymous quote , `` jackson 's stay at the cedar be arrange through david kuo ... ''
hold on --
the cedar be the headquarters of the fellowship foundation , the creepy christianoid cult with deep political connection .
here 's a bit of the original madsen article that the michael jackson quote come from :
in 1976 , the fellowship begin look for a permanent headquarters in arlington .
it set its sight on the estate of george mason iv , the cedar , locate at 2301 north uhle street .
mason be one of the drafters of the bill of right .
the fellowship , also know as the international foundation , buy the property from charles piluso .
although not much be know about piluso , the los angeles time report that howard hughes , the man with whom fellowship senator ralph owen brewster once spar , also live there .
accord to a senior pentagon official , the cedar have be use as a cia safe house prior to the fellowship 's purchase of the estate .
the fellowship pay $ 1.5 million for the cedar , the money come from tom phillips , the ceo of raytheon , and ken olsen , the ceo of digital equipment corporation .
sanford mcdonnell of mcdonnell douglas corporation be another deep - pocket supporter of the fellowship through full gospel business men 's fellowship international , an activity link to fellowship core member pat robertson .
suffer the little children , eh ?
if this be what power & wealth do to you , i 'm damn glad i have neither .
you say , `` perhaps rather the point be that the program exploit pre @-@ exist condition for abuse which be more common than most suspect . ''
could n't agree more .
i think that pedophilia 's relative commonality be what really make it frighten .
my experience happen when i be 15 .
a friend of mine met this guy who be twice our age & who be more than willing to buy us all the whiskey we could drink .
we be both enamored with kerouac & jim morrison & meet strange character & this guy definitely fit the bill .
he be muscle for a pittsburgh madam name tex gill .
she dress like a man & run most of the massage parlors in pgh .
he be into black magick & crowley & booze & drug & on & on .
& my buddy pass out .
i continue drink .
at one point , i glance at this older guy ,
& he be stare at my buddy as a line of drool run down the cigarette in his mouth & drip on to the floor .
he notice that i 'm kind of stare at him .
he stand up , walk into the bedroom , & come back with a porno mag .
he drop it on the couch next to me .
as he 's sit down , he say , `` see anything you like ? ''
& then he shove his hand hard into my groin .....
.... & i break his nose with my elbow .
i apologize for continue my ramble but ... ,
michael jackson
manchild in a promise land
by robert j. lewis
he 's such an easy target , michael jackson .
he make even the weirdest of the weird feel normal .
but unlike them , jackson do n't try to hide the fact that he be easily one of the most screw up being on the planet .
every time he check in for yet another surgery , he be announce to the world that he do n't know who he be , where he be go , and that he thoroughly loathe himself - at least the adult version .
and for his remarkable honesty , his most unprivate confession , he be subject to one public humiliation after another .
who among us rock thrower would have the courage to reveal about ourselves what michael have reveal about himself ?
next to the tower monument that the unedited michael jackson be we be telephone booth ;
next to his singular guilelessness and candor , we be the multitude of the prevaricate and pusillanimous .
everything michael have do and say during the past 20 year have be against his own apparent self - interest , begin with unrelenting surgical assault on his erstwhile good look , to hang his child ( and crotch for that matter ) out to dry , to enter detail of his bedroom antics into the public domain .
like a typical dostoievksy character , we can not account for the behavior if it be n't for an apparently override need to confess and proclaim -- over and against what the outside world want to believe -- the truth of who we be .
the on - go spectacle of michael 's increasingly bizarre conduct be his confession to the world that he be one spectacularly psychologically - challenged dude .
like children who be incapable of dissimulate their basic want and need , michael 's manner of be in the world be uncensored and spontaneous ,
and to such an unsuspected extent i propose he deserve to be consider one of the most authentic being of this or any other century , and quite properly belong to that exceptional society of authenticity - questers that would include saint augustine , pascal and heidegger .
the fact of michael 's life have be well document .
we know that by the age of 25 he be on top of the world .
thriller have sell an unprecedented 50 million copy and billie jean have become the musical drug of choice in every corner of the world .
not only be the song 's momentum and tension brilliantly craft and fuse , michael 's rivet , counterpoint choreography - which remain unsurpassed -- revolutionized the way we simultaneously look at and listen to music .
before disbelieve eye , his torso , head and limb supply never - before - see anatomical rejoinder to the note -- like a guitarist fill in between the lyric .
but from here on in , it would be downhill for the genre 's quintessential messenger , for michael could no long sustain the ' great lie ' he be live .
the child 's ' tin drum ' be beat ever louder in his head
and he intuitively understand that he be developmentally under - equip to handle the adult pressure of stardom .
far more compel than the promise of even greater fame and fortune be the example of oskar , from gunther grass ' the tin drum ( 1959 ) , which tell the story of a boy who refuse to grow up , who , through his drum , reject the adult world and the horror take place in nazi germany .
like oskar , michael have witness firsthand the abomination of adult behaviour and refuse to sign up .
from his early year , michael jackson be subject to both extreme psychological and physical abuse at the hand of his status - obsess father , who designate michael as the vessel into which he would mercilessly pour the acid of his unrealized ambition .
to this single end , joe jackson be ruthlessly single - minded .
michael be terrify of him , whose mere presence could induce nausea .
at the age of 5 , the father yank the son from his pail and sandbox existence and make him run hollywood 's grimmest gauntlet .
the little mouse that michael be suddenly find himself in the rat race and quickly learn to hate it ,
and like oskar , who find respite in the beat of his tin drum , michael find solace on stage , perform his music .
but the stage could not provide michael with immunity against the constant encroachment of the adult world .
listen to his rapid breathe in especially off the wall and thriller : the staccato - like pant of a stalk animal , the desperate breath of human panic , and his small boy 's voice hide behind the mesmerize slash and blur of arm and leg fending off an invisible attack .
from one track to the next , the lyric be n't so much sung as frantically whisper , the vowel cut short to the quick .
michael be announce that he could no longer follow the course father and hollywood have stake out for him , that the disparity between his real self and the role he be thrust into have reach unsustainable incommensurability .
only the child within could save the defenceless adult from the depredation of the adult world ,
and from this point on , michael would reduce the project of his life to let the world know the truth of who he be : a confused , fragile , lose soul in search of care and love .
by the time michael have attain mythic status , he be so far remove and alienate from himself , he would have to shed , over a period of 20 year and still count , one skin after another before his true self could begin to emerge .
as we might expect from someone so radically self - estrange , the result have be nothing less than a metamorphosis .
michael 's journey of self - discovery be a work in progress like no other because it increasingly depends on the accommodation of two irreconcilables : the child and adult as one .
more reveal of itself than its favorite target , public opinion have not see fit to grant michael the inalienable right to his confused mental state and ' off the wall ' comportment .
if most people subscribe to the notion that black and white be not only skin colors but state of mind , why be we baffle or offend when michael , who be introduce to the white way of hollywood at the age of 5 , tell us that he be n't sure what his true color be ?
rob of his childhood , abuse by a psychotic father and then prematurely subject to the adult pressure of the entertainment world , why be we surprise to learn that michael do n't want to grow up , that he prefer the company and community of children , that he want to be protect and look after ?
every time the androgynous jackson go under the knife he be cry out that he do n't know if he be man or woman , child or adult , black or white .
as if we would have do otherwise in his situation ?
and to the never - end suspicion that michael be a child abuser , what crime have be commit when two experiment 11 - year - olds fool around sexually ?
if you believe that michael have the mentality of an 11 - year - old , ( and there have n't be much evidence to the contrary during the past 20 year ) he should not have have to defend himself against accusation of child molestation .
was it in defense of perversity or his incorrigible innocence that convince him that it be ok to reveal that he share his bed with children ?
more questionable , even criminal , than michael 's alleged fool around with other kid , be the parent who allow , even encourage their children to sleep over and perhaps share the same bed with someone whose sexual predilection have be suspect since 1991 .
on june 13 , 2005 , the court find michael not guilty of the charge bring against him .
however , those whose mind be decide on his guilt before the trial begin will not be change by the verdict , just as michael 's essential nature will not have change .
mahatma gandhi write that ' there be a higher court than court of justice and that be the court of conscience . '
only michael know if he be sexually attract to children , and beyond that , if he have ever act on those feeling .
and if we grant him the mental age of an 11 - year - old , who have nonetheless conventionally father two children , michael be then a child trap in an adult body .
which mean the crown act in his quest for authenticity await one final operation .
what do a man do when he feel , act and respond like a woman trap in a man 's body ?
he undergo sexual reassignment surgery and hormone therapy in order to become who ' she ' be .
there remain one final procedure that will totally liberate the child that michael be .
when michael find the courage to act on what his duty toward other children demand -- submit to voluntary neuter -- which will be tantamount to his final confession , the save grace and glory that be his neverland will become his forever land .
tennessee williams have say for all time , `` there 's not enough kindness in the world . ''
and i say this to you , michael jackson , may your tribe increase .
`` thank god i 'm an atheist : ''
the surrealistic cinema of luis bunuel --
by bryan m. papciak
`` the thought of death have be familiar to me for a long time , '' say director luis bunuel .
`` from the time that skeleton be carry through the street of calanda during the holy week procession , death have be an integral part of my life .
i 've never wish to forget or deny it ,
but there 's not much to say about it when you 're an atheist '' ( 255 ) .
so read an accurate testimonial to the personal and artistic sentiment of this odd and serious filmmaker .
like many of his contemporary surrealist , bunuel be a paradox who on one hand claim apathy towards ultimate end , be , and be , yet on the other hand load his impressive body of work with moribund imagery and strange idea about the god he so vociferously deny .
bunuel exhibit a radical , iconoclastic view of the world in which he find society decadent and antithetical to human liberation .
he have be call a realist , a surrealist , a marxist , an anarchist , a mystic , an anticleric , a freudian , a post @-@ freudian , a sadist , a moralist , a christian , and a poet - showman of the macabre .
his scenario range from the absurd to the tragic to the satiric to the erotic , profusely endue with the outrageous and the scandalous .
luis bunuel have long be recognize in european critical circle as a great and prolific filmmaker on a par with eisenstein , chaplin , and fellini .
however , only recently have his reputation in america begun to catch up .
over his fifty - year career he direct thirty - two feature film and work in spain , france , mexico , italy , and the unite state .
utilize sardonic humor and the imagery of surrealism , bunuel set out to undermine the value and institution people take for grant .
his aim be specific : through the surreal , visualize the impulse of the uncon - scious , he would , he say , `` shatter the optimism of the bourgeoisie world and force the reader ( or spectator ) to question the permanency of the prevail order '' ( mellen 3 ) .
luis bunuel be born february 22 , 1900 in calanda , a small town in the province of teruel , spain .
as a youth he receive a jesuit education , display exceptional talent in music , athletics , and the natural science .
he enjoy a comfortable upbringing in a reasonably wealthy , close - knit family .
his family come from liberal , semi @-@ intellectual , land - own bourgeoisie .
these detail be not irrelevant .
to comprehend bunuel 's work it be essential to understand that he be first a spaniard and secondly a product of spanish bourgeoisie .
virginia higgenbotham point out that `` blasphemy be only a form of think for any intelligent spaniard , '' and also that the `` art of his country be rich in eroticism and profoundly preoccupy with death '' ( 18 , 20 ) .
bunuel say : my infancy slip by in an almost medieval atmosphere ( like that of nearly all the spanish province ) between my native town and zaragova .
i feel it necessary to say here ( since it explain in part the trend of the modest work which i late accomplish ) that the two basic sentiment of my childhood which stay with me well into adolescence , be those of a profound eroticism , at first sublimate in a great religious faith , and a permanent consciousness of death .
it would take too long here to analyze the reason .
it suffice that i be not an exception among my compatriot , since this be a very spanish characteristic , and our art , exponent of the spanish spirit , be impregnate with these two sentiment .
the last civil war , peculiar and ferocious as no other expose them clearly .
come of age , bunuel express a strong urge to go to paris to study music but be send instead to madrid to study agricultural engineer .
after a few year , he switch his study to entomology , and , more importantly , begin form close friendship with a group of young artist who be to influence him strongly in the future .
these companion include the poet frederico garcia lorca and jose moreno villa and the painter salvador dali .
in the madrid residencia bunuel develop his interest in the art , theater , and act and gain his introduction to surrealism .
after graduate in 1925 with a degree in philosophy and letter , bunuel move to paris , join by a few member of his residencia coterie .
bunuel arrive in paris highly recommend by influential friend of his parent and be introduce into the best intellectual circle of the city .
he be soon hire as an assistant director to jean epstien , `` the only director of that bleak era of the french cinema to merit the title of an intellectual filmmaker '' ( aranda 32 ) .
while hone his skill work as an a.d. , bunuel also begin contribute article to various literary cinema periodical , most notably la gaceta hispanoamericana .
in 1929 he formally enter the paris surrealist group .
within this set he embark on his first film project as director , a collaboration with his residencia friend salvador dali , entitle un chien andalou .
he collaborate with dali again in 1930 on another surrealist film , l_age d ' or .
the rest , as they say , be history .
some critic , most notably pauline kael and penelope gilliatt , now regard bunuel as the hitchcock of surrealism -- a venerated master in total command of his medium and for whom the art of filmic manipulation become a `` delightful form of play . ''
for bunuel , however , play have little to do with it .
rather , he see surrealism as a revolutionary , poetic , and moral movement :
all of us be supporter of a certain concept of revolution , and although the surrealist do n't consider themselves terrorist , they be constantly fight a society they despise .
the principle weapon be not gun , of course , it be scandal .
scandal be a potent agent of revelation , capable of expose such social crime as exploitation of one man by another , colonialist imperialism , religious tyranny -- in sum , all the secret and odious underpinnings of a system that have to be destroy .
he go on to say , `` the purpose of surrealism be not to create a new literary , artistic , or even philosophical movement , but to explode the social order , to transform life itself ' ( 107 ) .
salvador dali recall the surrealist ' ideology , `` it be possible to systematize confusion thank to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discredit completely the world of reality '' ( gould 37 ) .
indeed , the intent of surreal art be to move one from the conscious mind into the subconscious .
it seek to affect the emotion through the mind .
michael gould state in surrealism and the cinema , `` if the vision reveal be too much for the rational mind to absorb ( too intense , too threaten , too ' real ' ) yet can not be reject , then it leave the consciousness and come to exist on a sublime level as pure surrealism '' ( 13 ) .
in un chien andalou , for example , a girl 's eye be slice with a razor blade ,
a man wipe his mouth completely off his face ,
dead donkey carcass adorn a piano ,
a man 's hand crawl with ant .
each of these image be clearly too intense for rational thought .
bunuel be draw to the surrealist movement for more than revolutionary or psychological reason .
the moral aspect of the movement intrigue him as well :
for the first time in my life , i 'd come into contact with a coherent moral system that , as far as i could tell , have no flaw .
it be an aggressive morality based on the complete rejection of all exist value .
we have other criteria :
we exalt passion , mystification , black humor , the insult , and the call of the abyss .
inside this new territory , all our thought and action seem justifiable ;
there be simply no room for doubt .
everything make sense .
our morality may have be more demanding and more dangerous than the prevail order , but it be also stronger , richer , more coherent .
the surreal quality in bunuel 's film can be trace to a number of source ,
but the primary impetus be his `` irrational sensibility '' as evidence by his treatment of image , montage , and sound .
these give his film their dreamlike quality .
his most intense image be evocative of either humor or mystery .
mystery , he believe , be the essential element of any art ;
it be inseparable from chance ,
and the whole universe be a mystery ,
bunuel believe that his own form of atheism lead inevitably to the acceptance of the inexplicable .
`` since i reject the idea of a divine watchmaker , '' he say , `` ( a notion even more mysterious than the mystery it supposedly explain ) , then i must consent to live in a kind of shadowy confusion ....
at least it keep my moral freedom intact '' ( 174 ) .
predictably , adherence to fantasy as oppose to reason in a rationalistic society lead to conflict .
the surrealist oppose nearly all traditional value and , as note before , seek to destroy `` all conventional social , moral , and artistic habit of thought and perception '' ( higgenbotham 30 ) .
enter un chien andalou .
in 1929 , un chien andalou be as shock and scandalous as bunuel and dali have hope it would be .
it give rise to a stagger range of interpretation : poetic , scandalous , incoherent , an attack upon critic , an attack upon religion , and attack upon the bourgeoisie .
( interestingly , the film be finance by bunuel 's bourgeois mother . )
un chien andalou ( which mean an andalusian dog -- though there be no dog in the film ) be deliberately intend to jolt the spectator 's peace of mind and to convey some of the basic belief underlie the surrealist movement , include the omnipotence of desire .
bunuel state that he and dali hold to only one rule during the production ,
`` no idea or image that might lend itself to rational explanation of any kind would be accept .
we have to open all door to the irrational and keep only those image that surprise us without try to explain why '' ( 104 ) .
the aim of the film be not exclusively to shock , but to incendiarially affect the collective conscience .
at the same time it be an indictment of all the art consumer who , either through stupidity , masochism , or self interest , be willing to swallow anything , no matter how much it go against their instinct .
bunuel ask , `` what can i do about the people who adore all that be new , even when it go against their deep conviction , or about the insincere , corrupt press and the inane herd that see beauty and poetry in something which be basically no more than a desperate call for murder ? '' ( bauche 9 ) .
the film be a dream and , like a dream , be both fascinate and disturb .
the open scene in which a girl 's eye be slice set the tone of the film 's meander and confuse itinerary .
many of the element that make up the film be remnant of objective reality .
the way they be arrange within the scenario push them into a mental reconstruction process -- in exactly the way dream draw on the previous day 's experience .
interestingly , the image have the matter - of - fact quality of a newsreel , or what higgenbotham call a `` prosaic realism '' ( 38 ) .
bunuel choose not to use the distort lens , supered image , or blur focus ( cinematic convention of the day ) to suggest the dreamlike quality of his film .
instead , he approach the entire non @-@ narrative in a straightforward manner .
he use the shock incongruity of the image themselves to build the hallucinatory feel of anguish that run through the film .
the unrealistic fashion in which the realistic image be juxtapose be the perfect way , accord to freddy bauche , to illustrate `` the dramatic collision between desire and the object of desire '' ( 10 ) .
obviously , the director draw much of un chien andalou from his spanish heritage -- the religious and social implication , the theme of emotionalism and death , even the donkey carcass .
`` thus un chien andalou , as a milestone in the history of cinema , emerge from its director 's adolescence in spain and announce the theme and technique that be to preoccupy bunuel for half a century , through the rest of his career '' ( higgenbotham 39 ) .
where desire and eroticism prevail in un chien andalou , religion take center stage in simon del desierto ( simon of the desert ) , produce in mexico in 1965 .
simon del desierto be a bizarre little narrative set in the fifth century a.d.
saint simon , in order to be as close to god as possible , have stand pray on top of a sixty - foot pillar for thirty - seven year .
he be profoundly sanctimonious - to the degree that he even bless his own tooth when it fall from his mouth .
his devotion , however , be put to the test when the devil ( a woman wear the uniform of a catholic school girl ) arrive in a slither coffin at the pillar .
she be intent on lure the holy disciple from his perch as she repeatedly ridicule him and insult his character .
simon heroically resist her temptation at every turn despite her various disguise ; first , a priest , then a shepherd , and finally as the savior himself .
at last , despite simon 's holy strength , and for reason not entirely clear , the devil be able to exert her full power and whisk him away to hell -- a greenwich village disco where trendy writhe and grind to `` the radioactive flesh . ''
the implication be stagger .
`` the saint , devoted to his god , sit high on a pillar for all of life ....
but the pillar , discolored over the year , wind and twist its way to the ground , be the excrement of the saint .
saint though he be , his bowel must still move .
so there he sit , near god indeed , but support on a pillar of excrement '' ( mellen 115 ) .
there have be several interpretation of this seemingly blasphemous imagery .
one be that god and his church be really build on unacknowledged humanity .
another be that we can reach god only through understand the true nature of our humanity .
still another be that religion ( primarily catholicism ) be essentially a `` pillar of excrement . ''
bunuel himself put all the interpretation in perspective when he say , `` thank god i 'm still an atheist . ''
luis bunuel 's flair for perverse surrealism and his malicious attack on conventional morality be fully realize in his second to last film , le fantome de la liberte ( the phantom of liberty ) , produce in france in 1974 -- almost fifty year after un chien andalou .
fantome in many way function as a sort of sequel to his 1972 film , le channe discret de la bourgeoisie ( the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie ) .
the image be astound and playfully absurd :
spanish hostage of the napoleonic war cry `` down with freedom ! '' as they be execute .
a french lieutenant fondle the statue of a beautiful noblewoman and be struck on the head by another statue .
bourgeois couple discuss defecation around a toilet - line table but consider `` food '' an impolite topic , and so on .
the titular reference to a `` phantom '' boffows from the open line of karl marx 's communist manifesto :
`` a specter be haunt europe - the specter of communism . ''
bunuel twist this mean to imply that the specter haunt the bourgeoisie be `` the possibility of its own freedom unburden by the dead end of sexual license , willful irrationality , and the liberty to go beyond the self - indulgent eccentricity of the individual ego '' ( mellen 318 ) .
bunuel compare the film to one of his earlier surrealist work , l_age d ' or , say , `` it be no long possible to scandal @-@ ize people as we do in 1930 .
today you have to do it with sweet subversion '' ( mellen 183 ) .
le fantome de la liberte charge that society have substitute arbitrary willfulness for freedom .
one of the film 's vignette show two parent who insist on declare their daughter a miss person , although she be plainly sit in front of them .
the police , in a similar display of willful blindness to reality , even ask the child herself for her vital statistic and how she disappear .
in another episode , four chain - smoke monk gamble with their holy medallion in a card game .
`` i 'll open with a virgin , '' say one .
another play a `` father . ''
bunuel believe reality be actually a smoke screen for hidden urge .
he use the absurd to imply `` an attack on specific abuse , not on some safely vague condition of man '' ( durgnat 65 ) .
in le fantome de la liberte bunuel doubt not so much the possibility for society 's redemption as its likelihood .
`` we have be render unwittingly comfortable within our psychic cage to the point where we prefer them to liberty , an experience and aspiration we neither understand or desire '' ( mellen 331 ) .
for fifty year , luis bunuel make film about society 's dilemma .
his art be his declaration of confidence in a human race dominate by a bourgeoisie give to hypocrisy , sadism , and above all , a disrespect for its own capacity to live differently and better .
he summed it all up himself :
as i drift toward my last sigh , i often imagine a final joke .
i convoke around my deathbed my friend who be confirm atheist as i be .
then a priest , whom i have summon , arrive ;
and to the horror of my friend , i make my confession , ask for absolution for my sin , and receive extreme unction .
after which i turn over on my side and expire .
but will i have the strength to joke at that moment ?
luis bunuel die in 1983 .
note : there 's a piece by george packer in the new yorker ( '' betray : the iraqis who trust america the most '' ) about all this , but it 's way too long to blog here .
check it out if you want .
it 's hair - raise stuff .
christ , can no one trust an american anymore ?
i 'm gettting sick and tire of be ashamed of the usa .
what have we come to ?
fuck , piss , shit .
anyway , here 's a short piece from mother jones :
thrown to the assassin
they cheer the u.s. invasion ;
they offer to help , sign on as translator , risk everything they have to work for the unite state .
but when they have to run for their life , america slam the door .
by david case / mother jones
on the day the american tank roll into baghdad , abather abdul hussein and his wife , balqes abdel mohammed , throw flower .
literally .
after a lifetime of turmoil and tyranny , the couple fervently believe the invasion would bring peace .
abather join u.s. `` democratization '' effort , such as a project to create a govern council for his neighborhood , and he occasionally end up in the good - news iraq story that still seem plausible in those day ;
one u.s. paper run a five - column photo of him perch on a classroom chair surround by american soldier , with a story about the `` new iraq . ''
these day , abather and his young family be among the hundred of thousand of iraqis who have flee in fear for their life .
after month spend dodge insurgent who have targeted them for support the americans , he and balqes be relieve to have escape -- and bitter , like thousand of fellow refugee , that the superpower for which they risk their life have abandon them .
a short man who bundle his shatter body in layer against the desert 's winter chill , the 34 - year - old abather be polite and relax , with an easy smile .
an engaging conversationalist even in break english , he love to talk about baghdad , his infant daughter , and his wife , an outspoken woman several year his senior , whom he call a genius .
`` when we meet she be a professor at baghdad university , '' he boast .
`` i be her student .
when she walk into a room , hundred of people would stand to pay her respect . ''
consider that his life savings will run out in two month , that he can n't work legally in jordan , and that he could be deport at any moment , abather be remarkably stoic , though the anxiety leak out in tic .
he chain - smoke cheap craven a cigarette , crush the charred filter in an overflow ashtray ;
when balqes complain , he sheepishly offer that `` smoke be my only work . ''
it 's not quite true --
his one other job during the past 18 month have be recount his nightmare , over and over again , to border guard , embassy worker , and aid agency .
in december , he reluctantly tell it to me , pull document from a worn leather folder to corroborate the detail .
the story begin after the ouster of saddam , when abather and balqes , like many iraqis , launch a de @-@ baathification program of their own .
their target be the dean who have be balqes ' boss at baghdad university ( and who , as abather tell it , have force her out when she resist join the baath party ) .
balqes want her job back ;
one day abather confront the dean ,
and temper flare .
american soldier break up the brawl , bound abather 's wrist with a zip tie , and interrogate him .
he explain balqes ' gripe and what the loss of her job have mean for their family , include their 3 - year - old son and balqes ' 14 - year - old son from a previous marriage ( her first husband have be kill in the iran - iraq war ) .
though he hold a master 's degree in engineer , abather have n't be able to get a job in the doldrums of sanction - era iraq ,
so he be scrape together a live repair watch , his wife and children cram into his father 's small home .
`` the soldier be very understand , '' abather recall .
`` i be impress . ''
they offer the family an apartment in a place call iraqi village , a compound near the baghdad airport where saddam have house orphan he be groom to become fedayeen loyalist .
in return , the couple translate for the americans , and eventually the washington national guard 's 1 st battalion 303 rd armored regiment hire balqes as an interpreter , at $ 15 per day .
abather end up lead a u.s. army - contract security squad with a monthly salary of $ 130 .
learn that he be an engineer , soldier later gave him lucrative reconstruction assignment .
he start an engineer firm and work with contractor such as abb and kellogg , brown and root ;
in one heady year , abather 's contract would mushroom from a few thousand dollar to an $ 862,000 electrification project ( later canceled because he could n't procure the need equipment ) .
abather and balqes glow with wonder when they speak of those day , of earn a good live and have their own home for the first time .
most of all , abather enjoy hang out with the americans .
he seem to remember every soldier he ever meet :
captain philips and sergeant buchard give his children toy , a soccer ball , and school stationery ;
lieutenant glenn allen get so close to the family they call him `` uncle allen . ''
( allen confirm abather 's story in emails to me , call him and balqes `` very helpful individual '' who `` risk their life by meet with us . '' )
it be as if they have suddenly find themselves citizen of the 51 st state .
and so , in october 2004 , when abather get his first death threat , he think it be a joke .
it be handwritten , tuck under the windshield wiper of his car inside iraqi village , a gate community with american checkpoint at both its entrance ;
the note read :
abather , leave your work with the americans .
otherwise you will be kill by jihadis because you be a traitor .
jihad army
then the killings begin .
lieutenant allen have once give abather a photo depict two american soldier with five of their iraqi friend .
three of the iraqis be assassinate in short order .
abather begin to notice car follow him ,
and a few time shot be fire at his car .
the anonymous note grow increasingly menace .
eventually , iraqi village feel so dangerous that abather and balqes move the family back to his father 's house .
a death threat arrive there almost immediately .
still abather continue work with the americans .
one day in august 2005 , abather be drive balqes , six month pregnant with their second child , to a doctor 's appointment .
at an intersection , he notice a gold car park by the road ;
suddenly the two men in it leveled gun at him .
`` this be the end , '' abather think ,
and then a u.s. patrol appear
and the assailant vanish into traffic .
within day , abather and balqes have sell off their belongings and flee to amman .
their trouble have only just begin .
the u.s. embassy in amman be an attractive , arabian - style fortress , heavily guard machine - gunner in ford pickups .
it sit high on a hillside ,
and the view be so phenomenal that you can imagine your gaze reach all the way to the iraqi border , some 200 mile away .
in the foreground , amman 's roll mosaic of pale , boxy limestone building shimmer against the azure sky .
at its edge , in dank apartment on outlying hillside , life a substantial portion of baghdad 's educate middle class .
almost all flee in a panic , after get death threat or see love one murder ;
many be targeted by insurgent or jihadis because they support , or work for , the americans .
of iraq 's 27 million prewar population , about 1 in 8 -- some 3.4 million people -- have leave their home since the invasion , accord to the unite nation high commission for refugee ( unhcr ) ,
and more than half of those have end up abroad .
refugee international label this the world 's fast - grow humanitarian crisis .
yet the bush administration have refuse to so much as acknowledge the refugee ' plight , let alone help them get to safety or even provide basic humanitarian aid .
in the past , note bill frelick , refugee policy director at human right watch , the unite state have often aid those persecute for support it ;
since the vietnam war , 1 million vietnamese refugee have be resettle in the unite state , include ten of thousand of south vietnamese army veteran .
but the bush administration `` have abdicate that obligation , '' say frelick .
`` the people who have flee be the one the administration be relying on to build democracy in iraq ;
it would rather ignore them than acknowledge that its initiative have fail . ''
it be in jordan that abather and balqes discover the limitation of their friendship with the unite state .
lieutenant `` uncle '' allen have emailed the embassy in amman to explain that the family fear for their life ;
he 'd even offer to sponsor their relocation `` to the safety of the unite state . ''
an unsigned email from the embassy commend allen -- '' i know that your iraqi friend appreciate your friendship '' -- but note that u.s. visa be `` quite difficult '' for iraqis to get .
since 9 / 11 , middle easterners in general , and iraqis in particular , have face enormous hurdle get admit to the unite state ;
until 2005 , the bush administration maintain a total freeze on iraqis that shut out current refugee as well as hundred of people who have flee saddam hussein 's regime year earlier .
the email nonetheless provide instruction on get a tourist visa ,
and abather and balqes quickly file their application along with the $ 200 fee -- almost two month ' rent .
several month later they be notify that they could visit the unite state for up to three month , but that they could not bring their children .
they then make repeat visit to the unhcr to apply for official refugee status .
as it have with almost 99 percent of the iraqis who have come through its office in amman , the agency turn them down .
abather and balqes set their sight on a visa to australia , a major destination for iraqi refugee , and even hire an iraqi lawyer there .
they wait for month .
their savings dwindle ;
then their baby fall ill ,
and the emergency surgery , for an intestinal obstruction , cost $ 2,100 in cash .
in early june 2006 , abather get a rejection letter from australia .
around the same time , word come that his father have die of a heart attack .
so he go back to iraq to bury his father , help his mother find a place to live , and buy state - subsidize medicine for his daughter .
but when he return to the jordanian border less than a week later , he be tell he could n't reenter the country :
have recently suffer two terrorist attack , jordan have enact a ban on entry for iraqi men age 17 to 35 .
for two day abather stand on the highway at the border post , beseech successive shift of immigration official .
finally , a guard promise to send the medicine to his family in amman if he would just go away .
once again abather head back to baghdad .
drive in baghdad a few day later , he notice a bmw -- the iraqi gangster 's vehicle of choice -- in his rearview mirror , closing in .
the car force him off the road ;
arm man blindfold him and knock him unconscious .
when he wake up , he be in a tiny room , handcuff to a chair .
mask men come and go , videotape as they curse him as a traitor .
they whip him with a steel cable ;
six month later , his back be still etch by deep , evenly space groove .
`` we 've be search for you for a year , '' his captor tell him .
abather recognize the voice of one man , an acquaintance from iraqi village who have seem to befriend the americans .
`` i 'm sorry your father pass away , '' the man say .
soon , a bearded imam sentence abather to decapitation for collaborate with the unite state .
abather barely hear the proceeding .
`` i be think the whole time about my little daughter in amman . ''
he be tell he could save himself by spy on the americans , but he refuse .
on the eighth day , the men ask if there be anything he want before he die ;
then they put him on the floor in the back of the bmw and speed off .
suddenly , abather hear gunshot .
the men shout .
the car crash ,
and everything go black .
he wake up in a hospital bed 60 mile from baghdad ;
iraqi force have attack the bmw and pull him from the burn wreck .
he have a compound fracture in his leg and severe burn all over his body ,
but the nurse urge him to leave :
his captor would be look for him .
his brother -- who have receive a ransom note from the kidnapper , complete with a photo of abather bound and gag -- brought him back to baghdad , where doctor fuse a piece of plastic onto his shin and graft skin from his thigh over his wound .
a few week later , he be back at the jordanian border ,
and this time the guard take pity .
the family have n't tell balqes of the kidnap .
but when she see her disfigure husband , she say , `` i know right away what happen . ''
on a crisp , clear day this past december , clutch a sheaf of paper document abather and balqes ' ordeal -- contract , soldier ' recommendation , death threat , a miss - person report -- i head to american citizen service at the u.s. embassy in amman .
abather and balqes have make several pilgrimage there ;
they be convince that if only they could speak to an american , abather 's char and mangle flesh would make their case , but they have never get past the jordanian security guard .
outside the embassy , i join a chatty , eclectic crowd of americans : a retire hippie turn english teacher from vermont ; a woman with a new york accent who struggle through the narrow eye - slit in her black veil to keep track of her hyperactive daughter ; a white - bearded man in a santa hat , who say he be pick up his passport before return to the north pole .
i wonder whether any of us would risk our life for the unite state as abather and balqes have .
to get past the compound 's first wall , we navigate a metal detector , a body frisk , and an x @-@ ray machine ;
after cross a 30 - foot no man 's land we repeat the process at the second wall .
then we wait to be call .
the unite state admit more refugee than any country in the world ,
but in 2006 , only 202 iraqis be allow in ,
and most of them have flee persecution under saddam before the war .
this year , million of iraqis , tibetans , sri lankans , and afghans must compete for a mere 5,500 refugee slot congress have allocate for the middle east and south asia .
the iraqis be in line behind their compatriot who have be wait in jordan since the late 1990 s .
like other western representative , u.s. official here refer displace people to the unhcr , which be charge with determine whether someone be a real refugee , and if so , with find him a safe place to go .
except that , as amman unhcr head robert breen tell me , a 1998 agreement with jordan forbid the agency from classify anyone as a refugee whom it can n't get out of the country within six month -- an impossibility in the post / 11 world .
( a country of about 6 million , jordan have long have the world 's highest refugee population per capita , host more than a million palestinians who flee israel in 1948 and be suppose to stay only a short time . )
of the 21,000 iraqi asylum seeker the office have register since the u.s. invasion , only 291 have be grant refugee status ; meanwhile the line outside the unhcr 's gate get longer every week ,
and the wait for an interview stand at five month .
to care for all of the region 's displace iraqis , the agency have a total budget of $ 22 million in 2006 -- less than $ 7 a person , which must cover not only the kafkaesque registration programs but also basic survival aid to refugee trap in desert camp or squat in abandoned building .
recognize the potential for `` severe humanitarian suffer , '' the iraq study group in december recommend that `` the unite state take the lead '' in fund the unhcr 's iraq program ;
currently it donate no more than a quarter of the budget .
direct u.s. aid to the refugee consists of a tiny grant to the catholic relief organization caritas ( see `` how to help , '' page 68 ) .
at the embassy , i recount abather and balqes ' ordeal at window 3 , then at window 1 -- the setup be similar to visitation in a high - security prison .
then , at window 4 , i tell the story again to the consul general , who stood behind the bulletproof glass wear a telephone headset .
i be expect to hear that `` the unite state be do its best to help , ''
but there be only silence as the consul 's eye well up .
( an amman - based aid worker later told me that american diplomat be so distraught by the policy they be charge with represent that `` it just take a few gin and tonic and they 'll break down . '' )
finally , the consul say , `` we hear story like this all the time .
we have enormous empathy for the iraqis who 've suffer after work with the americans ,
but there 's really nothing the embassy can do for them . ''
she hand me a document outline congress ' sole concession to people like abather and balqes : visa for up to 50 military translator from iraq or afghanistan each year .
`` but do n't get their hope up , '' she add quickly ;
there be thousand with the same story .
`` this be something congress really need to address , '' she say as we part .
the administration certainly do n't seem incline to take the initiative .
philip a. frayne , an embassy spokesman in amman , tell me that `` there be no reliable figure '' on how many people have flee iraq , and that in any case , it be saddam who drive out `` a large percentage '' of them .
likewise , in its 2006 annual refugee report to congress , the state department focused mainly on those saddam - era exile , and blithely intone , `` it be hope that significant number of iraqi refugee will soon be able to return home , although the security situation will remain an important consideration . ''
the report ignore the fact that , accord to a survey by the nonprofit u.s. committee for refugee , 644,500 new refugee enter jordan and syria in 2005 alone .
and 2006 will likely be worse .
as much as a quarter of greater amman 's population be now iraqi ,
and the crowd have exacerbate the city 's severe water shortage .
price have skyrocket .
until recently iraqi children could n't attend jordanian school ,
and their parent can not legally work ;
easily identify by their dialect , iraqis be discriminate against and terrify of deportation .
some refugee never go outside .
jordanian government spokesman nasser s. judeh tell me that his country , a staunch u.s. ally and aid recipient , `` certainly need help , and have hold discussion with u.s. diplomat '' about this issue .
incidentally , human right watch have also call upon the gulf arab state to pitch in ;
saudi arabia 's response so far have be to plan construction of a 560 - mile wall along its border with iraq .
before i leave jordan , abather invite me to visit his family and a physician friend from baghdad who share their two - room basement apartment .
on the al zawraa tv channel from baghdad , we watch u.s. army vehicle disappear behind roadside bomb blast as a man sang , `` let 's go kill the americans ! ''
the channel 's endless stream of anti @-@ american propaganda perplex abather and his friend :
`` why do the unite state allow this ? '' they inquire .
when image of dead children supposedly kill by the americans hit the screen , abather 's friend switch to a channel on which voluptuous arab women dance in an un @-@ islamic way .
balqes serve iraqi coffee ,
and to keep the baby from play with the colorful cup , abather suspend her from an elastic swing above our head .
she giggle as he bounce her by her tiny foot .
this be her prison , he joke .
six month after the kidnap , he still have n't get the surgery he need to heal his burn flesh ;
if the wound become infect , he could die .
abather rarely complain .
god be test us , he say .
but we will get through it .
he look at the girl bounce from the ceiling and smile .
i have a daughter ,
and i 'm very happy .
balqes be more fearful -- twice in the past month , suspicious men have show up at the apartment .
iraq , she worry , have already catch up with them .
how to help
very few organization be work on get aid to iraqi refugee , and of those that be , many be too small or too beleaguer to accept individual donation ;
the iraqi red crescent , for example , have suffer bombings and mass kidnappings , yet its volunteer continue to deliver aid to displace family inside iraq .
one of the larger relief organization work with the refugee be the catholic group caritas , whose caseworker i shadow while in amman .
buck the image of the land rover - drive aid worker , they make their round in an aging gray honda , its roof eat through by rust .
they visit iraqi doctor , engineer , and executive desperate for food , heat , or blanket to fend off the desert winter ;
one family tell the crew they have just sell their stove to buy food .
caritas help a few thousand family a year ,
but the demand far outstrip the money available to us , say magy mahrous , who oversee the project .

to ensure that the money reach the iraqi program , write iraq - icmc on your check .
at first , i sign up for a blog on donews , think that it be a site for it professional where i could perhaps find friend more easily .
later , i sign up for another one on msn , feel that write on msn might make it easier for me to communicate directly with my msn pal .
but gradually , i discover that both site be not very good .
at that time , donews do not have the function of tally traffic statistic ( i have the habit of look at the statistic of everything ) ; and even though msn have that function , others need to sign on to msn before they could reply , this meant that after read the entry , many could not reply even if they want to , hence largely reduce the interactive element .
the enthusiasm with write the blog at the begin be short - lived ; after write a few original article for promotion , i do not continue anymore .
at that time , i do n't think about post article from other site as i feel that there be no need to post any article if i could not come up with anything original ; this meant that sometimes for over two month i do n't even update a new entry .
later , there be also some minor problem with both msn and donews , so i become more unwilling to post new article .
so , these two blogs have not really be very popular , either
one of the hypotheses state : a long time ago , in order to hide from wild beast roam on the land , human have ever live in shallow water region for a long period of time , survive on aquatic plant and fish .
therefore , the body hair , which increase the friction in water , have fall off .
the reason for this explanation be that the fine hair on the back of human run from one side of the shoulder toward the spine , a different direction from that of monkey .
only such a direction could reduce the friction in water , and provide more buoyancy for the person who be swim in the water .
however , in all the primitive gather settlement that have be discover so far , we have not see any settlement where people live in such a way .
what be worse be -- from the perspective of the direction of the fine hair as well -- the fine hair on human ' upper arm point downward , while the fine hair on the lower arm point upward , which be to say , they all run toward the elbow .
this be somewhat similar to monkey who have hair : when it rain , they would hold their head with their hand , and such a direction of their hair would be easier for the rain to flow away along their elbow
what be saddam prosecute for ?
earlier on , iran 's involvement with the euro - for - oil transaction turn out to be a big news item with negligible after - effect , and finally it become a non @-@ issue , and hence there be no problem for iran and the unite state .
but this time , putin come up with a ruble - for - oil proposal , and even begin intensive preparation .
nobody would have any doubt about the technical capacity of russia , not to mention its ability to protect its own resource and trade system ,
the intimidation that russia have inflicted on ukraine be still remember with a tinge of fear by some european brother - like country .
the ruble be allow to float freely now , but everyone still have sufficient reason to doubt the replacement of the us dollar in dollar - for - oil .
but what be more vicious about comrade putin be that he have roll out what be know as a " barbarous " gold system ; and that be , before the wide acceptance of the ruble - for - oil , a portion of russia 's annual oil revenue would be channeled toward increase the country 's holding of gold .
this be the first among all major country to have issue such a clear proclamation - no wonder the recent link between gold and oil have almost be sever .
follow the government 's announcement of new immigration regulation , all travelers arrive in new zealand will receive the same treatment as they would receive when go to the us .
when they enter the country , they will be ask to provide biometric information .
at a press conference this afternoon , new immigration law confirm by immigration minister david cunliffe will give immigration official the power to collect , store and use biometric information of non @-@ new zealand citizen .
these so - call non @-@ new zealand citizen include people with a tourist , temporary or residency visa .
these new regulation be very similar to procedure for enter the us .
the new immigration law also permit the immigration service to provide " limited " biometric information on new zealand citizen to neighboring country .
however , the law do not explain the reason .
cunliffe say , it have presently not be decide when or how the biometric information will be collect from people 's body .
the government have introduce legislation that will permit further collection of dna sample from people 's body .
the new regulation on biometric information be only one article among the sixty - one article that make up the new regulation .
cunliffe say the new regulation will effectively simplify border - entry procedure and protect citizen ' right and international human right .

in the face of criticism and nitpick , i believe that jesus be weaker than darwin .
why ?
because darwin be allow to make mistake , since he be a human be ; but jesus be not allow to make mistake , since he have be describe as god .
darwin propose evolution theory , but it be just a theory , and he himself also admit that there be many question ,
others may agree with him , or they may accept some part while disagree with other part , or in the future we might discover that the general direction of darwin 's evolution be largely correct though fill with a lot of error , and that there might be an improve version of evolution which be more accurate and comprehensive than what darwin have propose .
but as the originator , darwin deserve much credit .
jesus be god , and the bible be the word of god .
god create everything , understand everything , predict the future , and be infinitely resourceful , so how can he be wrong !
therefore , if you find a sentence that be allegedly say by god , but effectively turn out to be wrong , then this god will be overthrow .
therefore , jesus be more vulnerable to criticism than darwin , because once an error be find , then he could not be the true god .
after the collapse of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime , iraqi religious force have enter a period of revitalization and expansion ,
although the distribution system of the new legislative power in iraq have generally take care of the interest of all party , and find a relatively reasonable balance point among all ethnic group and sect -- otherwise a management committee , the interim constitution , and the current interim government would not have be successfully generate -- this do not mean that there be no contradiction among them .
from an internal point of view , shiites and kurds tend to see eye to eye on the political and economic benefit , and iraqi politics have almost become the arena of these two faction ,
although under the balance of interest some of sunni political figure be involve in politics , what the sunni radical group be most concern about be that the shiites would turn around and suppress them in the future .
in february of this year , a radical sunni organization attack the ali mosque , which be the religious shrine of shiite muslims , and this lead to the eruption of the conflict between iraq 's two largest party .
the assassination of the lebanese minister of industry have trigger off angry protest from supporter , plunge lebanon into yet another precarious situation .
in merely two short year , this minister be the fifth senior official to be assassinate ; this show that even after the force withdrawal of israeli troop , long - suffer lebanon still have n't usher in the peace that it hope for yet .
the unite state claim that the syrian government be the murderer , but syria retort by say that the accusation be " totally without foundation , and in disregard of fact . "
at this moment , the real murderer be probably titter , but the world have clearly see that any one of the regime of lebanese and iraqi be more fragile than the other .
the western media say that in the " post @-@ bush " garbage era , country like iraq , syria , and lebanon will encounter a lot more good show or terrible tragedy .
and the people believe that .
it be uncertain whether the canadian prime minister have take the political equivalent of viagra , or have lose his mind due to political bias , but he " lose his temper " several time in china during apec , and almost mess up his meet with president hu .
fortunately president hu be magnanimous enough not to take it to heart , and give him the honor of a 15 - minute meet .
however , when this fellow return to his own country , he boast recklessly by say that his meet with president hu have " important historical significance , " and even exaggerate by claim it as his " major diplomatic achievement . "
but those canadian opponent already disgruntle with him , see through his trick , could immediately tell that the meeting that president hu have such as with bush , abe , and putin all last over an hour ; a mere 15 - minute meet with you -- exclude the pleasantry and translation -- be no different from an extended hand - shake .
this early morning the soccer match between the chinese women 's team and the korean team have indeed make me excite , i be surprise by the match 's brilliance , and i also gain a new understand of the korean team .
they attack swiftly and fearlessly and coordinated with tacit understand , but look back at the chinese women 's soccer team , it be in an inferior position either in time - control or coordination .
we lose this game with no complaint .
but look at the match between the chinese men 's soccer team and the iranians , that goal -- the insult , provocative , and perverse goal -- make me question the quality of the iranian team and even of the people in that country .
the chinese team show their gut during this game ; they manifest the courage and fight spirit of chinese people .
we do not shy away from the powerful iranian team , but do our best ; it be n't until after an overtime and two round of penalty kick that we then regretfully lose the match .
let us remember the iranian team , remember this iranian player who score this goal -- borhani .
the ioc warrior return to our motherland with hope .
i believe there will eventually be a day when we will -- avenge
