resolutely support the thread starter ! i compose a poem in reply :
pledge to fight to the death defend the diaoyu island and the related island
fleet bump fish boat . little evil japanese ghost stir up trouble and unrest . with heart of thieve and arrogant form , they again show their wolfish appearance
never go back to that time , our humiliate appearance when sign the treaty . china be strong , sword be sharp and knife be shine , let 's bury the approach enemy !
september 11 th , 2010
i agree with the analysis of the thread starter , resolutely bump up . if war really come , i would like to be hua mulan , to protect our home and defend our homeland , to spread the prestige of our china , to pledge to fight to the death defend our national dignity .
i very much wish i have be born in those passionate and upsurging time of mao zedong , the long march , lose my head and shed my blood , completely extinguish all the enemy that wrong china , spread our dragon prestige !
how long be we go to tolerate japan ?
my fellow citizen :
hello , everyone ! we all know the " september 18 th " incident , but now japan again have a premeditate plan for another " september 18 th " on the sea , another " lugou bridge on the sea ".
japan surprisingly defy the strong condemnation of the whole world , openly invade our country 's sacred territory , " the diaoyu island ".
as we all know , the " diaoyu island " have always belong to china ; due to historical reason , what originally belong us have become controversial .
my fellow citizen , ours be ours , what need be there to negotiate ! japan thus go even further - want to create a fact of occupation . can we allow this ? no - absolutely not !
my fellow citizen , japan 's militarism have bring the people of asia grave disaster .
especially china suffer the ravage of japan for as long as several decade .
in the northeast , japanese unit 731 cruelly conduct human body experiment on live people of china , korea and other country , the method of which be extremely brutal ; the nanjing massacre add a layer of blood to the ancient capital which will never fade away ; the big bloody battle at hengyang and changsha lay bare the bone of the dead over a thousand kilometers and kill off everything ...
my fellow citizen , of the heinous crime commit by japan in china , there be too many instance to cite , difficult to record without exhaust all bamboo strip .
it 's just as if those ten million decease soul who lost their life be wander over the pacific ocean , find it difficult to rest in peace .
all the people who experience that era must still remember it vividly ; even our younger generation also will cry with tear stream down our cheek , and our blood boil with indignation , whenever we turn to this page of history and read !
now japan actually want to reverse the verdict on the history of its aggression - fellow citizen , fellow chinese in asia , wake up !
although it be painful to look back at these hundred year of shame , we must go face it ; although historical issue have not be resolve , let us create and choose history !
since there be responsibility , we be not afraid . the territory be small , but it be relate to the matter of dignity ; no matter how the wind and cloud change , the interest of the country and national unity be the guarantee of honor ; even though scar with wound , we can not let our native land be separate !
my fellow citizen , for the chinese nation , the advent of the twenty @-@ first century mean a time when we be beset with difficulty inside while be press from outside , and we will face many challenge .
the taiwan issue , the tibet issue , the south china sea issue , the surround environment , as well as the foreign force which be aggressive to china - which way should we go ?
what to do , fellow citizen ? please take a look at the map of the world , that crescent @-@ shape encirclement be suppress our breathe , strangle our development , and covet our national territory .
we do not want to make enemy , but be never afraid of enemy ; we do not want war , but be never afraid of war .
we must urgently arrange arm , strengthen all military force on land , on sea , and in the air .
over thousand of year , the chinese nation have flourish several time , but before it have never have ambition to expand its territory outward .
not impose on others what we do n't want ourselves , what we follow be a foreign security strategic philosophy which apply benevolence and virtue .
the tolerance and liberalness of a country be like those of an individual - we avoid hurt others , but must insist on not be hurt ourselves .
tolerance be certainly not fear , and sincerity do not have to be cowardice .
china exempt japan from war reparation for world war ii be in service of peace , benevolent peace .
my fellow citizen , the people 's hero monument be a condense history of the chinese nation strive for continuous self @-@ improvement
the solemn and magnificent posture represent a sacred expectation for peace .
the thought @-@ string of my memory have be agitate from time to time - many heroic , stir , and tragic scene of shine spear and armored horse spring up in my mind .
my thought go through those yellow page of history , as if i see emperor kangxi , the famous ruler of a generation , contemplate alone about how to achieve unification of the territory in his audience hall , hundred of year ago ; also as if i see abraham lincoln , former u.s. president , wander alone in the dark of a great hall , think about the integrity of the union .
" although it be peaceful throughout the world , it be certainly dangerous to forget war ! " my fellow citizen , we want development and peace , but we must never exercise forbearance blindly . the " boxer protocol " of national betrayal and humiliation have aggravate china 's poverty and backwardness in modern time - fall behind will lead to be bully .
without strength , where do peace come from !
we must focus on national defense education , build up a great wall in the heart of 1.3 billion people , and must establish the full range of a national defense system have the ability to both attack and defend ;
the best defense be to attack - we should strengthen force which can engage in ultra @-@ long @-@ range attack , improve combat capability throughout all of aerospace , of great depth , and over great distance . on the premise of avoid influence on national economic development , increase investment and construction of the defense industry , accelerate modernization and internationalization of military equipment , and establish a high @-@ quality , high @-@ tech elite division .
the battle horn be about to sound , the people be already fully equip and ready to go .
without the people 's support we will accomplish nothing ; with the support of the people , we will be all @-@ powerful .
my fellow citizen , it be time for us to say " no " to others . therefore , we must achieve :
1. establish guarantee fund , improve work environment and mechanism , recruit back to china the hundred of thousand of it professional who have emigrate to and linger in the unite state and around the world .
2. create a few nuclear @-@ power aircraft carrier battle group .
3. manufacture 5000 advance combat aircraft of various kind .
4. accelerate the research and deployment of high @-@ speed intercontinental ballistic missile which can break missile defense system and whose range be more than 10,000 nautical mile .
5. resume nuclear experiment , and establish military force in space .
6. retain 1000 nuclear bomb equivalent to ten million ton of tnt , and when necessary , install nuclear warhead on all short @- and middle @-@ range missile .
7. retain 30 strategic nuclear submarine with the ability to inflict three devastate nuclear strike against enemy .
8. abandon the commitment to not use nuclear weapon first .
9. retain the right of pre @-@ emptive strike when national security be threaten .
my fellow citizen , only if we have self @-@ confidence and self @-@ improvement , can we strive to be strong . qin shi huang unify china . zheng chenggong recover taiwan . in our responsibility we must carry on the farsightedness , insight , and strong will of our predecessor .
now , that piece of land tremble far away from the embrace of the motherland be shake , moan , and call . fellow citizen , let us carry forward the unfulfilled wish of previous general , move forward courageously !
when read over history , the heaviness and anger in my heart simmer into concern for the nation . although i be born to cloth gown and am one of the common people , for the prosperity of the motherland , for the motherland be splendid once again , i be willing to voluntarily serve our country , and i will have no regret even if i die ! my sincere patriotic heart be adequate to show to heaven !
here , i 've compose a poem in classical ci form , to voice the aspiration of my heart .
paint the deep red lip
protect the diaoyu island
bitterly lose our ryukyu island
how can we allow the diaoyu island to fall to other country
one hundred year of vicissitude
smoke and cloud chase the fly wave
young brother be still a tender youth
wander in all direction , bear a seal
look over to the flag
brandish our weapon and cross to the east
let the horse drink from the pacific ocean

", " contemporary garbage writer , shameless li yinhe , please let the children off the hook "
why do n't we fight with little japan ?
what do chinese still tolerate ...
they be ride even on our head
be this still what chinese with gut do ?
we should tell the whole world , that chinese can n't be bully at will by others ...
it be time to show our strength ! china have be calm for too long !
currently our citizen ' life be all too carefree ! the official be too extravagant .
now we already have no cohesion ! china need to start a war ! a harsh slap in the face of the country which follow the unite state ' rear !
let them know that the us be not a panacea ! if we win , it may increase china 's influence ! and improve the cohesion of the citizenry ! if we lose , we can clean out those incompetent bureaucrat , and make those trash get out ! let china have new blood and get update . , get up , china !
go , china , go
i suggest that china strengthen the guard on the diaoyu island , make it daily , protect the fishermen and the sovereignty of our country ; if japan dare to invade our territory with military force , we will fight a small @-@ scale war of self @-@ defense , regardless of the cost . china can not lose !
we need show in life , but it be really p. to show yourself within someone 's embrace .
i 'm just pass by
the whole society be like this , not to mention the star
damn it be not sexy
it 's totally unacceptable
agree , just cheap entertainer . their reputation in feudal china somewhat make sense .
their life look glorious
a group of people of nine profession
life be hard .
:shocked :
that 's normal , it have always be the case that a whore be heartless and a performer be unrighteous
they want money , not the face
have a look at the " wolf with glass " near ms. fan , you will know the actress have no choice but drink with him or she will be force out or even frame .
sob
it 's ok as long as there be something to eat :loveliness :
no one be easy . life be like a show , you must have a look at the script to know how to perform
all be sb
there be top scorer in the imperial examination in all 360 walk of life ! what effort and endeavor behind those top scorer in the imperial examination ! this be humiliate the word " bean vermicelli "!
haha
overdo
the reality
shoot those hooligan
cheap performer
cheap performer !
the entertainment circle be a dirty one , all men in it be bird and beast and scum
pity them , but who be to blame ? those female star be not easy
everybody be do this , how can you make money if you do n't do this
she be a proud woman in front of others but be in melancholy mood when stay alone ...
to put it plainly star nowadays be just popular prostitute in ancient time . now that they be famous prostitute , it should be just normal to drink with some high official or even sleep with them
stop talk about others just behave yourself
what should we do in the future ! ability alone be n't enough to become successful ! are we goin ' to face such hard choice too ?
more suffer be under the disguise of glorious look , ' tis the undisputable fact .
it 's not so bad , they 're just play in their own circle , out of sight , out of mind ,
not like the old guy zhang jizhong not only behave like a hooligan in his own circle , but also think he be virtuous without any talent . he make tv series when he have nothing to do to wreck people of the whole country .
both take what they need
when can china have a pure , innocent girl ?
a story be now very shock in the entertainment world . it be rumored that hsu yuki have be force out because she refuse to drink with a guest as arranged by the company and have to switch to work as a lawyer 's assistant instead to make end meet .
much envy super star often encounter social engagement or circumstance which they do n't welcome but have to join in ,
after all , there be many thing they can n't decide themselves ' cause that will have to do with many aspect and the interest of many people ,
sometimes a dinner party which seem very normal for us ordinary people may not be that simple for star as we imagine .
a star will have lot of contract and her source of money will be roll if she tackle well ; if she do n't tack well , what come after her heel would be forcing out or even frame @-@ up ...
there be two kind of smart female star . those of the first kind always hold very high integrity and sternly reject all such invitation ;
the second kind be good at play the trick and make their objective achieve with their seed money ,
it 's rumored that even some super female star win their first role in this way .
after drink some alcohol , the advertiser or show sponsor may take the chance to lie on the female star 's shoulder , feel her chin or kiss her cheek , and endurance be the attitude most adopt by the female star .
they be the very people of lower nine profession
those star be just pretend , they be all actually live a much damn better life than this
agree , just cheap entertainer . their reputation in feudal china somewhat make sense .
agree !
ah well , it be not easy to be an actress
they deserve it . they ask for that .
it dawn on me nothing be easy !
the women be bird and beast , and the men be worse than bird and beast
braawwk !
braawwkkk !
it do n't take long .
route 288 , the circumferential highway run around the south - western quadrant of the richmond new urban region , open in late 2004 .
already it be change development pattern for the worse and cause localize traffic congestion around its exit .
the richmond time - dispatch tell the tale today about the impact on the huguenot trail in powhatan county .
traffic have more than double in one section of huguenot trail since 288 open , report will jones .
speed and accident have surge as well :
17 accident have be report near the intersection of winterfield road so far this year , up from 12 for all of 2004 .
dale totten , resident engineer for the virginia department of transportation , note that vdot would four - lane the road for about $ 13 million if it have more money .
of course , vdot have no more money for road construction in the richmond region .
one reason be that vdot , at the behest of local politician and booster , spent all its friggin ' money on 288 !
where 's homer simpson when you need him ?
this be a major `` d'oh ! '' moment .
as we predict , route 288 be generate residential development in scarcely populate area all around its exit , overtax the local country road .
while the limit access highway might provide limit traffic relief for people drive back and forth between chesterfield and goochland county , other people be make choice about where they live and work ,
and they be create traffic congestion in new place .
the only thing that surprise me be how rapidly this be happen .
even i think there might be a lag of three or four year .
if route 288 have already create a $ 13 million road - construction in just this one exist , think of the liability it have create for all of its exit !
here 's another prodiction :
after a few more year of scatter subdivision development and approval of mega @-@ commercial project at major 288 intersection , the need for new road improvement will soar .
before the end of the decade , we may well see the unfunded liability zoom well past the original $ 400 million it take to build the original highway .
to the brainiacs who thought route 288 be such a great idea :
thank for nothing .
i think we could have spend the $ 400 million better elsewhere .
i do n't think you can blame 288 for create those people .
if there enough of them to create new traffic congestion in new place , then what be the alternative ?
additional traffic congestion in old place ?
now you understand how people like tmt in fairfax feel .
i 'd usually take the pro @-@ road position -
but with the glare need in other part of the state , 288 be definitely excess ...
you have a city , richmond , that have virtually no traffic .
the rush hour be 30 minute long ...
and you give them a beltway through a largely rural area .
a road to no where ...
just think if this money have be spend on another potomac cross or road improvement that be desperately need in nova ?
virginia centrist , to add insult to injury , the rest of the state help pay for 288 in last year 's budget deal -- wipe the slate clean of debt .
it be very nice of y'all to oblige us .
did n't make much sense , though .
it 's the same old problem .
if you get out ahead of the need you be accuse of cause sprawl .
if you build where the need be already acute , then the claim be you can n't pave your way out of congestion .
anonymous -
that 's a fair point .
5 @:@ 26 make a good point .
however , this situation hammer home the validity of the state auditor 's report find that the ctb and vdot fail to fund transportation project based on a comprehensive state transportation plan , but rather , based on whoever do the best job of lobby .
i submit that this be a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerate .
moreover , senator chichester and his toady would make this worse by pour more money into this flawed institution .
what be the purpose of transportation - related expenditure ?
in virginia , it 's to benefit private business plan and not to serve the public interest .
you all be dead wrong .
no less than walter stoch state that 288 money be intend to be pay from economic development money .
come on folk !!
tmt : i do n't understand your point .
when be the last time you be stuck in traffic that you be n't on your way to or from some sort of business ?
it seem to me that the whole point of road be to facilitate the public interest in get to and from private business .
then , of course there be the sunday drive , the trip to grandma 's , and the soccer game , but still , the overwhelm need be to support business .
since our road expenditure nowhere near match the increase in business or state domestic product , it be no wonder we suffer congestion problem .
if we recognize that road primaarily benefit business then we should do two thing :
let business pay for more of our transportation bill , ( which they will pass to us , of course ) and incentivize them to locate where they put the least stress on the system , even if that mean more overall travel .
why be it so hard to understand ?
the solution be functional human settlement pattern and a balance between transport system capacity and land use generate travel deman .
all else be spin .
emr
tmt say `` in virginia , it 's to benefit private business plan and not to serve the public interest . ''
i do n't see the point of this statement because it appear to demonize private business plan and put the public interest above all else .
i think they be so tightly intertwine that they be virtually one and the same .
obviously there be local problem because this cookie dough be lumpy ,
but in the aggregate if we demonize business long enough we will eventually find out we all work for the devil .
i do n't see there be any point in claim as `` a solution '' a balance that be dynamic and ever change in nature .
even you see rail to dulles as a positive because dulles be a job center that promote bi @-@ directional demand on the rail .
i agree .
in fact that may be sufficient reason to build it , all by itself .
all i 'm say be that the exact same logic should apply to road :
they should have destination at both end in order that we get maximum use out of our investment :
we need more place in order to get closer to the balance you say we need .
reality check here -
i drive past watkins land every morning and even .
i commute back and forth to work on the huguenot trail .
i 've never see anything remotely resemble a `` flood '' of traffic .
it 's a 55 mph zone - 75 to 100 car in `` a morning '' - over how much time ?
the huguenot trail road widen be already plan , due to the heavy demand of development on the chesterfield side , the new school , and a whole bunch of exist development that be zone year ago and at that time funneled through robious road .
288 , for those of us that actually use it , be wonderful - instead of powhatan and western chesterfield be bottlenecked by lack of road ,
we can actually get some commercial development and have the ability to work closer to where we live .
you may think that 's not rational land use .
i have no desire to live in any city ,
i will not work in a downtown area ,
i will not use mass transit , which be not safe for female commuter that work long and irregular hour ,
and i happen to like large lot development .
how exactly i 'm suppose to keep horse on a 1 @/@ 4 acre lot be beyond me .
gas could go to $ 10 a gallon
and i 'd still pay to live in the country .
many people have legitimate preference - horse , hunt , garden , certain type of small business - that make them not want to live in an urban core .
this infatuation with city live truly baffle me .
anonymous 6 @:@ 37 , you have every right to live in the country if that 's where you wish to live .
but you do n't have a right to have the rest of the state to underwrite construction of a $ 400 million highway to make it easier to shop and get to work .
what 's consistently overlook in the debate ovre 288 be what else that $ 400 million could have be spend on .
how much traffic congestion could have be alleviate have the money be apply to other press road project or , god forbid , even non @-@ road project .
ray hyde - my comment be direct at investor who lobby to place road near where they own property and the incompetent system that fund these request without regard to their link or lack thereof to a master transportation plan .
i be 24 and a mother of a 2 and a half year old .
me and my son 's father have be break up since august .
i want to start date other people and my son 's father say if i do he will have nothing to do with his son .
he be very possesive and control but he have no right to be as we be not together .
he have too much go on in his life right now and he think we can work when i have tell him several time i dont love him and he do not love me .
i want him to be there for his son without need me too .
but he have no one his family and him dont get along and have their own issue .
i do n't want to be miserable anymore and the long he be around the more miserable i will be .
i dont want him to not be there for his son as he be a good father or he at least try .
i do believe every child need both parent weather they be together or not .
but he think if he cant have me no one can .
what do i do to move on with my life .
your ex be threaten you use your son... bad , bad , bad .
you can n't give in to that or it will just escalate .
you have a right to live your own life and be happy , so do n't cave to his threat .
if he really love his son , he 'll see him regardless , but this be just a typical control method that people like him use .
others say thing like , " i 'm go to kill myself if you leave me "... get it ?
date .
meet all kind of people .
do what you want .
if the price be , he voluntarily walk out of both of your life , you 're probably better off without him .
i 'd agree - one other thing it be none of his business whether you date or not .
i would n't tell him .
not because of his threat - but because your personal life be none of his business .
can you document his threat ?
you really need to .
quit take his call , make him leave voice mail .
make him email or text you .
keep those record .
get a lawyer and get a divorce .
if you can n't afford one , try legal aid .
tell your ex that all communication need to go through the lawyer .
the bus driver want exact change , the till people want exact change , the people who deliver your food want exact change...
do they not realise that you do n't get pile of change from the bank ,
someone somewhere be go to have to take the note ?
people be get lazy .
i do like to get as near as possible as i woudn't like to be couting copper all day
take a £20 note on the bus , they just tell you to get on cos theyre lazy as hell
its illegal to pay certain amount in load of coin . such as you can only pay something like 30 pence in 1 ps
hello i start university in september , do n't immediately gel with it obviously like most people .
however , i know it would take me some time to adjust , because i have always be very introvert , and shy and especially anxious and all the rest of it .
the first night i be here , all my housemates and i go out and it be the hardest thing i have ever ever have to do .
to go into the su bar on my own , sober .
anyways more to the point ; here be the fact :
- i be not enjoy university have be here 5 month or so ; i 'm disillusion by the course , not enjoy the project set , and i do n't like the course delivery as much .
the university make out it be much better than it seem .
- i have a bad start to the first term ; student finance be delay , add to my stress level , i be so worry i be unable to progress with work , conclusively it all pile up .
- i be assign a counselor through the university ; have see her for about 5 @-@ 6 week ( block session ) , if i 'm honest it do n't really work ; because i be never open with her .
only half @-@ halfheartedly .
- now the work @-@ load be up to my neck , i have major deadline to hit , i be depress , the anxiety be result in me feel miserable all the time .
in no long have a counselor because you can only have them for so many session at a time , and i doubt it will help much this time , if it have n't already .
- i lack motivation , do n't feel comfortable with any of my lecturer , feel like i want to give in , but can n't bring myself to it , because i will end up in a dead end job , and i aspire to ' be someone '.
- i would rather be dead than not be educate , and live a life i want to live ( and drop out of uni would make matter worse ) .
- i 'm 21 yrs old ( turn 22 this year ) , do n't have much time leave for fail need to do something .
i fail college once over , do another course so i could get to uni do n't want to go through the system over and over and consistently fail .
can someone please give me some advice please ?
perhaps go and see your doctor , and see if there 's any way you can get your deadline extend to try and ease the pressure a bit ?
send your tutor a similar email to this post ( do n't worry they 've see it all before - some much more uncomfortable admission too - i know as i use to work in a uni dept admin ) and they will consider mitigate circumstance .
break your work into manageable chunk .
concentrate on one bit of work at a time ( obvs the most urgent assignment first ) .
do n't shut yourself off from your housemates , and well do for try new thing from the very begin now keep at it !
i 'd reccomend you go and see your doctor too .
if you 've always be an anxious person you might benefit from speak to someone ( my friend get therapy on the nhs for anxiety , so its really normal ) .
and try and get deadline extend , if you 're honest i 'm sure your uni will allow it .
it 's get hard to keep strong and keep carry on with life .
my mum be get divorce - she have a horrible time with my step @-@ father and her new found freedom have send her round the bend .
she 's epileptic and a manic depressive with a huge anger problem .
she 's horrible to me , constantly .
i can n't cope with her outburst and nasty hateful remark when i 'm at home .
i 'm 18 , a full @-@ time sixth former at a high pressure private school ( on a 95 % bursary ) and i 'm at break point .
i can n't do work at home , because she shout at me .
so then my teacher get angry at me .
one minute she 's lovely , and it 's like have my mummy back , then the next , she turn into the most spiteful human alive .
i 'm not go to pass my a2 exam , i 've already accept defeat , that this year of my life be go to make me a failure .
maybe i can come back from this , who know . i 've get the most amaze university offer , but i can n't even accept them - i 'll never make the grade .
i wish i could wipe her out of my life - thing would be so much better without her .
but then , i think i 'm just be selfish .
but surely , my life be n't meant to be like this ?
it should be so much better . b
ut i feel as if i have no control over this downhill spiral .
and i do n't know what to do .
thank for read .
it 's nice to vent .
you can n't get her section for that .
do she even have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis ?
you do n't know for sure that you won't get good grade so accept place if you can .
life throw **** at you all the time .
if it 's not someone in your family , it 's an outsider .
i have to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for a long 8 year before i come to uni and honestly , the only reason why i 'm here be because it be the only way out .
work hard if you really want out .
really sound like you need support from somewhere else if she can n't give it to you consistently .
you could call childline or something similar ?
you could go to the library on saturdays and do a good 8 hour of study there .
be there a friend 's house you could go to @- form a study group ?
so you want her section cos she be a bit of a pain in the arse and you 've blame all your problem on her ?
i know what you 're feel .
my mum be spat out of hell too .
i highly recommend take up smoke
oh grow up tsr and stop negging its be a joke ! !!
i think over the last year or 2 i 've become a much weaker person and in a way have dull down my personality inorder to try and make some friend at uni .
but be overly @-@ nice to people have lead them to believe that they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me...
they show absolutely no respect .
e.g. i 'll say hello to someone from uni and they 'll ignore me , but 30 minute later they 'll decide they want my help with some work... and i 'll give it to them .
it 's cause alot of anger and distress in my life and be really start to effect my concentration in uni .
have anyone get any experience in handle this sort of thing or how to go about gain some respect again ?
just say no.
do it gradually if it 's not something you 're particularly comfortable with .
you could start with ' no , sorry but i 'm busy '
of course , do n't go over the top with it lest you go in completely the opposite direction .
if , in your mind , you 're think no - say it .
when they start to realise that you 're not go to bend over backwards for them , they 'll start respect you more .
well this be such a bad attitude really , of course you can be respect if you 're nice but not to the point where you just let them do anything to you , that 's not be nice it 's be a fool .
i do n't know if anyone will read this , but i just feel desperate and feel the need to tell someone .
this september i leave home , and start at university . i be incredibly anxious about do this , but rather delay think about it until i get here ! now i 'm here , and have be for over two week , i feel terribly overwhelm by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward .
i have be struggle emotionally for the majority of my life since move to secondary school , although i do lose my dad at around the age of 9 and always use to blame that for my feeling . i have have two period of counsel in my life , over roughly 15 month from december 2009 until around march this year .
i feel at the moment like the problem in my life be incredibly overwhelm , and be make me ever more doubtful of my always low self @-@ esteem . i have no ability to concentrate on work , often find myself become very quiet in social occasion , and doubt myself over anything and everything .
neither of my counsellers have diagnose me with depression , and both have suggest i do not suffer from it , but it be a huge worry to me , as depression be the cause of my dad 's death , suicide .
i have try to solve my problem before , and have find exercise and meditation particularly useful , and have also try thing like self @-@ help book and tape . but my general feel , be , ' be this what my life will be ? my one chance at existance , my one chance of be a young man , i be waste it ! ' and these feeling be beat away at me .
i simply do n't know what to do , and when i think of thing to do , i never follow through with it . friend often say i 'm lazy , and i can n't disagree a lot of the time . i feel like everything anyone could do to help , people have try , and time and time again i fail .
sorry to anyone whose read this jumble mess , and i feel a bit like a self @-@ seek moaner , but i truly do feel desperate .
its not uncommon for people 's exist feeling about themselves to become more intense when they be in new situation and feel the pressure to socialise with stranger and fit into new role , i.e. be a university student .
i be not a health professional and i can only speak from personal experience which be why i strongly suggest you see a qualify health professional about your feeling and worry about depression .
most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni @- you 're definitely not alone there . but i would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counsel service . it do n't really matter whether anyone have tell you that you be depress or not , you be obviously have some problem at the minute and could use some support @- label be n't as important as your experience . meditation and exercise be really helpful , so definitely try to do those . but yeah , you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere @- but do n't beat yourself up about feel unmotivated to do anything at the minute , lot of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better . be unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse @- be kind to yourself and get some help .
good luck .
i think a lot more people feel the same way as you do , but medicate themselves by use friend . whilst it probably be n't a ' solution ' as such , be around friend whilst be depress be definitely better than be alone and be depress . either way , if you fancy a chat , feel free to pm
if i be you id focus on an idol . someone you aspire to ( not want to be them but someone who your admire and have respect for ) e.g. someone who come from a bad background and end up successful and happy with a family and marry etc etc
focus on what you want to achieve in life , you havent state what your study , or indeed why....is it because you want the experience ? because your mum want yo to go ? because u need a degree for the career you want to do ?
either way , sum up why youre there and work your bottom off to get the best grade you can , cos once you get ur degree , you wil have something you can say " hey i didnt fail , it be hard work and i pass "

i 'm pretty much non @-@ autistic ( not diagnose with dyspraxia but i think the doctor misdiagnosed ) , but i walk on my toe nearly all of the time .
it 's more comfortable to me .
what make them decide toe @-@ walk be a sign of autism since it seem so random and be n't always indicative ?
well i might have sign of something on the autism spectrum but who do n't have one or two ?
you guy know what i mean .
walk on toe can be a symptom of autism .
have a headache can be a symptom of brain tumour .
feel tire a lot can be a symptom of leukaemia .
symptom do n't always apply but if they happen in a lot of case ( which it clearly must do in this instance ) it 's worth note , since otherwise nothing would ever get diagnose .
i use to walk on my toe , but that be because i be born with strange toe that curl under and have to be straighten with surgery two year ago .
my brother 's autistic but i have n't notice this with him either , but the spectrum be so broad and i myself probably have mild asperger 's because i have problem with communication and do n't pick up on social reaction @/@ body language .
but then i do n't have a proper diagnosis and even have some symptom might not mean you have a certain condition .
i walk on my toe not as much since year of be tell not to .
i have dyspraxia .
so maybe you be dyspraxic or have short tendon .
people who do dance/ gymnastics/ ballet etc have it drill into them , to the point where i find it more comfortable now =p
i would n't read too much into random " symptom " like that

thank you for read
are you on any drug or get any therapy ?
it might be an idea to talk to your school nurse or your gp and tell them what 's go on .
perhaps there 's a teacher at school who you trust and could tell .
if you tell people they can help you ,
if you keep it bottle up inside it 's likely to only get worse .
trust me , it 's better to get these thing as early as possible rather than let them get even worse .
please do n't do this ,
i 'm 17 i start self harm last year , mainly cut my arm , but i have stop since the last few month ,
its hard but you can do it .
i feel so much happier , but see the scar be both a painful reminder of how i feel at that time , how strong my feeling be that i would want to do such a thing to myself !
and , also strength , you can do it , i find salvation in poetry write and keep a journal ,
self harm be addictive , but you can overcome it ,
remember your self harm do not define who you be .
you can overcome it .
so i think ive got a form of ocd because for the past year , i 've find that everytime i go out , especially to uni , i 'm always check my belongings to make sure i have n't lose or leave anything .
i often have to check twice at one go , then after 30 second for some reason i cant resist check again !
why be this ! ?
am i go crazy or something ?
it happen most often when i 'm carry many thing , but that be rarely and even still daily i 'm check many time . and be this ocd to any extent ?
what can i do about this ?
if i do n't check , i get very very anxious , which do sort of go away after 15 @-@ 30 mins , but often the anxiety be so much that i can n't wait that long .
i feel if i lose my wallet or phone , then i 'm doom or so i feel .
i just wish i could go out without worry every 2 mins whether i 've leave or lose something .
i really dont know what to do , and am afraid of go to the gp .
they 've probably never hear of some compulsion like this and i just dont know what to do
do any of you have a similar ' ritual '?
people would think i 'm crazy , but it 's very strangely difficult to get yourself out of this .
what advice could you give me ?
i use to do this on my way to college @-@ i have a list of item i know i have on me and use to check compulsively on the bus .
i now have more severe anxiety and think this be just a warn sign so just try and wean yourself out of the habit while it 's relatively fresh @-@ definitely visit your doctor but also tell yourself not to keep check these thing ( easier say than done i know ) .
doctor will have see much worse case so do n't worry about that !
i do about ocd in psycology today :p
to get rid of it , one way could be just to avoid the compulsive act so do n't check to see whether you have lose something , just leave it (:
even though your anxiety level would increase for a duration , they will gradualy decrease so hopefully , overtime your ocd will disappear (:
to me that just sound like you be overly anxious , as oppose to have really bad ocd .
i be very obsessional to the point where i get up 20 time a night to check the lock in my house be all lock a particular way .
sometimes although i know they 're lock i 'm convince they 're not .
i think it become a real problem when the obsession start to really interrupt your everyday routine .
you definitely be n't crazy though do n't worry and your gp will be understand of the issue i 'm sure .
i go to therapy ( for other reason also ) and they have encourage me to pick a number of time to check , obviously that be less than 20 , and to stick to it and cut down that way .
i think the idea be to teach me , i 'm still ' okay ' if i check 5 time or 20 time .
so far i have be a lot better , i think there be definitely hope of improvement for anyone that want it .
usually i 'm pretty calm about thing and like to take thing as they come and not to worry too much .
however , over the last month or two i 've find myself become really anxious about thing , and i 'm not talk about a mere out of the blue feel of nervousness .
i have begin to feel irrationally panicky about a variety of thing which beforehand would n't worry me too much or even cross my mind as something to cause alarm bell to ring in my head .
i 'm not sure if it 's the change in lifestyle ( go from care @-@ free student to unemployed graduate ) that be cause this or if it 's a sign of other issue , but it 's begin to bug me as it 's affect my confidence and happiness .
i 've speak to a few people about it include my parent but they all think the same : that i 'm go through a random phase and that i should hold off take action until it be clear that it be a serious problem
so be wonder what 's the best thing to do ?
speak to a doctor about it and see if anti @-@ anxiety pill could take the edge off of thing ?
see if i can speak to a counsellor ?
or should i take the advice give by the close people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it become a problem ?
well i woudnt try to keep an eye on ur anxiety for a start because that will make u tense and more likely to become more panicky ( circle of demise there )
what i would try to do be focus on something that be garunteed to make you smile or feel happier as soon as you start to feel a bit panicky about anything .
or if u cant do that @-@ when you start to feel panicky , get one of your friend to make you laugh ( it work for me and i suffer from random panic attack lol
this start happen to me , where i 'd just start be really anxious over tiny thing , although from the sound of thing , not as severely as you .
what i find help be just talk about what be make you anxious to someone else .
perhaps not in a moany way but i find that mention the thing that i be worry about to my mum and see her react to the situation in a calm way ( like i should have be react ) made me feel better about it because i know it be n't a big deal and i do n't need to be anxious about it .
however , if it get worse , then yes , go to the doctor 's .
i have a friend who suffer from severe anxiety that can prevent her from leave the house and do thing because she 's so worry about what can go wrong .
the doctor give her medication and it 's make her much better .

the dynamic at the nsg be that official from the country do not want to be obstacle to india which be the largest country and the unite state which be the most powerful country .
consensus on india will be difficult to reach when the nsg meet in november 2007 .
israel 's proposal give official from some country reason to suggest an alternative approach to a specific exemption .
israel 's record be good and better than india 's in follow international nuclear rule .
despite tie between israeli and u.s. government the bush administration reject the israeli proposal .
