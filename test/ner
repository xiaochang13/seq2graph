Resolutely support the thread starter ! I compose a poem in reply: 
Pledge to fight to the death defending the [ORG Diaoyu Islands] and the related islands 
Fleets bumping fishing boats . Little evil [MISC Japanese] ghosts stirring up trouble and unrest . With hearts of thieves and arrogant form , they again show their wolfish appearance 
Never go back to that time , our humiliating appearance when signing the treaties . [LOC China] be strong , swords be sharp and knives be shining , let 's bury the approaching enemies ! 
September 11th , 2010 
I agree with the analysis of the thread starter , resolutely bump up . If war really comes , I would like to be [PER Hua Mulan] , to protect our home and defend our homeland , to spread the prestige of our [LOC China] , to pledge to fight to the death defending our national dignity . 
I very much wish I had been born in those passionate and upsurging times of [PER Mao Zedong] , the [LOC Long March] , losing my head and shedding my blood , completely extinguishing all the enemies that wrong [LOC China] , spreading our dragon prestige ! 
How Long are We Going to Tolerate [LOC Japan] ? 
My fellow citizens: 
Hello , everyone ! We all know the " September 18th " Incident , but now [LOC Japan] again has a premeditated plan for another " September 18th " on the sea , another " [LOC Lugou Bridge] on the sea " . 
[LOC Japan] surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world , openly invaded our country 's sacred territory , " the [LOC Diaoyu Islands] " . 
As we all know , the " [MISC Diaoyu Islands] " have always belonged to [LOC China] ; due to historical reasons , what originally belongs us has become controversial . 
My fellow citizens , ours is ours , what need is there to negotiate ! [LOC Japan] thus goes even further - wants to create a fact of occupation . Can we allow this ? No - absolutely not ! 
My fellow citizens , [LOC Japan] 's militarism has brought the people of [LOC Asia] grave disasters . 
Especially [LOC China] suffered the ravages of [LOC Japan] for as long as several decades . 
In the [LOC Northeast] , [MISC Japanese] Unit 731 cruelly conducted human body experiments on living people of [LOC China] , [LOC Korea] and other countries , the method of which were extremely brutal ; the [LOC Nanjing] Massacre added a layer of blood to the ancient capital which will never fade away ; the big bloody battles at [LOC Hengyang] and [LOC Changsha] laid bare the bones of the dead over a thousand kilometers and killed off everything .. . 
My fellow citizens , of the heinous crimes committed by [LOC Japan] in [LOC China] , there are too many instances to cite , difficult to record without exhausting all bamboo strips . 
It 's just as if those ten million deceased souls who lost their lives are wandering over the [LOC Pacific Ocean] , finding it difficult to rest in peace . 
All the people who experienced that era must still remember it vividly ; even our younger generations also will cry with tears streaming down our cheeks , and our blood boils with indignation , whenever we turn to this page of history and read ! 
Now [LOC Japan] actually wants to reverse the verdict on the history of its aggression - fellow citizens , fellow [MISC Chinese] in [LOC Asia] , wake up ! 
Although it is painful to look back at these hundred years of shame , we must go face it ; although historical issues have not been resolved , let us create and choose history ! 
Since there is responsibility , we are not afraid . The territory is small , but it is related to the matter of dignity ; no matter how the winds and clouds changes , the interests of the country and national unity are the guarantee of honor ; even though scarred with wounds , we can not let our native lands be separated ! 
My fellow citizens , for the [MISC Chinese] nation , the advent of the twenty-first century means a time when we are beset with difficulties inside while being pressed from outside , and we will face many challenges . 
The [LOC Taiwan] issue , the [LOC Tibet] issue , the [LOC South China] Sea issue , the surrounding environment , as well as the foreign forces which are aggressive to [LOC China] - which way should we go ? 
What to do , fellow citizens ? Please take a look at the map of the world , that crescent-shaped encirclement is suppressing our breathing , strangling our development , and coveting our national territory . 
We do not want to make enemies , but are never afraid of enemies ; we do not want war , but are never afraid of war . 
We must urgently arrange arms , strengthen all military forces on land , on sea , and in the air . 
Over thousands of years , the [MISC Chinese] nation has flourished several times , but before it has never had ambition to expand its territory outward . 
Not imposing on others what we don't want ourselves , what we follow is a foreign security strategic philosophy which applies benevolence and virtue . 
The tolerance and liberalness of a country are like those of an individual - we avoid hurting others , but must insist on not being hurt ourselves . 
Tolerance is certainly not fear , and sincerity does not have to be cowardice . 
[LOC China] exempting [LOC Japan] from war reparations for [MISC World War II] was in service of peace , benevolent peace . 
My fellow citizens , the [ORG People 's Heroes Monument] is a condensed history of the [MISC Chinese] nation striving for continuous self-improvement 
The solemn and magnificent posture represents a sacred expectation for peace . 
The thought-strings of my memory have been agitated from time to time - many heroic , stirring , and tragic scenes of shining spears and armored horses spring up in my mind . 
My thoughts go through those yellowing pages of history , as if I saw Emperor [PER Kangxi] , the famous ruler of a generation , contemplating alone about how to achieve unification of the territory in his audience hall , hundreds of years ago ; also as if I saw [PER Abraham Lincoln] , former [LOC U.S.] President , wandering alone in the dark of a great hall , thinking about the integrity of the [LOC Union] . 
" Although it is peaceful throughout the world , it is certainly dangerous to forget war ! " My fellow citizens , we want development and peace , but we must never exercise forbearance blindly . The " [MISC Boxer Protocol] " of national betrayal and humiliation has aggravated [LOC China] 's poverty and backwardness in modern time - falling behind will lead to being bullied . 
Without strength , where does peace come from ! 
We must focus on national defense education , build up a [LOC Great Wall] in the hearts of 1.3 billion people , and must establish the full range of a national defense system having the ability to both attack and defend ; 
The best defense is to attack - we should strengthen forces which can engage in ultra-long-range attack , improve combat capability throughout all of aerospace , of great depth , and over great distances . On the premise of avoiding influence on national economic development , increase investment and construction of the defense industry , accelerate modernization and internationalization of military equipment , and establish a high-quality , high-tech elite division . 
The battle horn is about to sound , the people are already fully equipped and ready to go . 
Without the people 's support we will accomplish nothing ; with the support of the people , we will be all-powerful . 
My fellow citizens , it is time for us to say " no " to others . Therefore , we must achieve: 
1 . Establish guaranteed funds , improve working environment and mechanisms , recruit back to [LOC China] the hundreds of thousands of IT professionals who have emigrated to and linger in the [LOC United States] and around the world . 
2 . Create a few nuclear-powered aircraft carrier battle groups . 
3 . Manufacture 5000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds . 
4 . Accelerate the research and deployment of high-speed intercontinental ballistic missiles which can break missile defense systems and whose range is more than 10,000 nautical miles . 
5 . Resume nuclear experiments , and establish military forces in space . 
6 . Retain 1000 nuclear bombs equivalent to ten million tons of TNT , and when necessary , install nuclear warheads on all short- and middle-range missiles . 
7 . Retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines with the ability to inflict three devastating nuclear strikes against enemies . 
8 . Abandon the commitment to not use nuclear weapons first . 
9 . Retain the right of pre-emptive strike when national security is threatened . 
My fellow citizens , only if we have self-confidence and self-improvement , can we strive to be strong . [PER Qin Shi Huang] unified [LOC China] . [PER Zheng Chenggong] recovered [LOC Taiwan] . In our responsibilities we must carry on the farsightedness , insight , and strong will of our predecessors . 
Now , that piece of land trembling far away from the embrace of the motherland is shaking , moaning , and calling . Fellow citizens , let us carry forward the unfulfilled wishes of previous generals , moving forward courageously ! 
When reading over history , the heaviness and anger in my heart simmer into concern for the nation . Although I was born to cloth gown and am one of the common people , for the prosperity of the motherland , for the motherland being splendid once again , I am willing to voluntarily serve our country , and I will have no regrets even if I die ! My sincere patriotic heart is adequate to show to heaven ! 
Here , I 've composed a poem in classical ci form , to voice the aspirations of my heart . 
Paint the deep red lips 
Protect the [LOC Diaoyu Islands] 
Bitterly lost our [LOC Ryukyu Islands] 
How can we allow the [ORG Diaoyu Islands] to fall to other countries 
One hundred years of vicissitudes 
Smoke and clouds chase the flying waves 
Youngest brother is still a tender youth 
Wandering in all directions , bearing a seal 
Looking over to the flag 
Brandish our weapons and cross to the east 
Let the horses drink from the [LOC Pacific Ocean]

" , " Contemporary garbage writer , shameless [PER Li Yinhe] , please let the children off the hook " 
Why don't we fight with little [LOC Japan] ? 
What do [MISC Chinese] still tolerate .. . 
They are riding even on our head 
Is this still what [MISC Chinese] with guts do ? 
We should tell the whole world , that [MISC Chinese] can't be bullied at will by others .. . 
It is time to show our strength ! [LOC China] has been calm for too long ! 
Currently our citizens' lives are all too carefree ! The officials are too extravagant . 
Now we already have no cohesion ! [LOC China] needs to start a war ! A harsh slap in the face of the countries which follow the [ORG United States'] rear ! 
Let them know that the [LOC US] is not a panacea ! If we win , it may increase [LOC China] 's influence ! and improve the cohesion of the citizenry ! If we lose , we can clean out those incompetent bureaucrats , and make those trash get out ! Let [LOC China] have new blood and get updated. , Get up , [LOC China] ! 
[LOC Go] , [LOC China] , go 
I suggest that [LOC China] strengthens the guard on the [LOC Diaoyu Islands] , make it daily , protect the fishermen and the sovereignty of our country ; if [LOC Japan] dares to invade our territory with military force , we will fight a small-scale war of self-defense , regardless of the cost . [LOC China] can not lose ! 
We need shows in life , but it is really p. to show yourself within someone 's embrace . 
I 'm just passing by 
The whole society is like this , not to mention the stars 
Damn it being not sexy 
It 's totally unacceptable 
Agree , just cheap entertainers . Their reputation in feudal [LOC China] somewhat makes sense . 
Their life looks glorious 
a group of people of nine professions 
Life is hard . 
:shocked: 
That 's normal , it has always been the case that a whore is heartless and a performer is unrighteous 
They want money , not the face 
Have a look at the " wolf with glasses " near [LOC Ms. Fan] , you will know the actress has no choice but drink with him or she will be forced out or even framed . 
[ORG SOB] 
It 's ok as long as there is something to eat :loveliness: 
No one is easy . Life is like a show , you must have a look at the script to know how to perform 
All are SB 
There are top scorer in the [ORG Imperial Examination] in all 360 walks of life ! What effort and endeavor behind those top scorer in the [ORG Imperial Examination] ! This is humiliating the word " bean vermicelli " ! 
[PER Haha] 
Overdoing 
The reality 
Shoot those hooligans 
Cheap performers 
Cheap performers ! 
The entertainment circle is a dirty one , all men in it are birds and beasts and scum 
Pity them , but who is to blame ? Those female stars are not easy 
Everybody is doing this , how can you make money if you don't do this 
She is a proud woman in front of others but is in melancholy mood when staying alone .. . 
To put it plainly stars nowadays are just popular prostitutes in ancient times . Now that they are famous prostitutes , it should be just normal to drink with some high officials or even sleep with them 
Stop talking about others just behave yourself 
What should we do in the future ! Ability alone isn't enough to become successful ! Are we goin' to face such hard choices too ? 
More suffering is under the disguise of glorious looks , 'tis the undisputable fact . 
It 's not so bad , they're just playing in their own circle , out of sight , out of mind , 
Not like the old guy [PER Zhang Jizhong] not only behaved like a hooligan in his own circle , but also thinks he is virtuous without any talent . He makes TV series when he has nothing to do to wreck people of the whole country . 
Both take what they need 
When can [LOC China] have a pure , innocent girl ? 
A story is now very shocking in the entertainment world . It is rumored that [PER Hsu Yuki] has been forced out because she refused to drink with a guest as arranged by the company and has to switch to work as a lawyer 's assistant instead to make ends meet . 
Much envied super stars often encounter social engagements or circumstances which they don't welcome but have to join in , 
After all , there are many things they can't decide themselves 'cause that will have to do with many aspects and the interests of many people , 
Sometimes a dinner party which seems very normal for us ordinary people may not be that simple for stars as we imagined . 
A star will have lots of contracts and her source of money will be rolling if she tackles well ; If she doesn't tack well , what comes after her heel would be forcing out or even frame-ups .. . 
There are two kinds of smart female stars . Those of the first kind always hold very high integrity and sternly reject all such invitations ; 
the second kind are good at playing the trick and making their objectives achieved with their seed money , 
It 's rumored that even some super female stars won their first roles in this way . 
After drinking some alcohol , the advertiser or show sponsor may take the chance to lie on the female star 's shoulder , feel her chin or kiss her cheek , and endurance is the attitude most adopted by the female stars . 
They are the very people of lower nine professions 
Those stars are just pretending , they are all actually living a much damned better life than this 
Agree , just cheap entertainers . Their reputation in feudal [LOC China] somewhat makes sense . 
Agree ! 
Ah well , it is not easy to be an actress 
They deserve it . They asked for that . 
It dawned on me nothing is easy ! 
The women are birds and beasts , and the men are worse than birds and beasts 
Braawwk ! 
Braawwkkk ! 
It did n't take long . 
Route 288 , the circumferential highway running around the south - western quadrant of the [ORG Richmond New Urban Region] , opened in late 2004 . 
Already it is changing development patterns for the worse and causing localized traffic congestion around its exits . 
The [ORG Richmond Times] - Dispatch tells the tale today about the impact on the [ORG Huguenot Trail] in [LOC Powhatan County] . 
Traffic has more than doubled in one section of [LOC Huguenot Trail] since 288 opened , reports [PER Will Jones] . 
Speeding and accidents have surged as well : 
17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of [LOC Winterfield Road] so far this year , up from 12 for all of 2004 . 
[PER Dale Totten] , resident engineer for the [ORG Virginia Department of Transportation] , noted that [ORG VDOT] would four - lane the road for about $ 13 million if it had more money . 
Of course , VDOT has no more money for road construction in the [LOC Richmond] region . 
One reason is that [MISC VDOT] , at the behest of local politicians and boosters , spent all its friggin' money on 288 ! 
Where 's [PER Homer Simpson] when you need him ? 
This is a major " D'oh ! " moment . 
As we predicted , Route 288 is generating residential development in scarcely populated areas all around its exits , overtaxing the local country roads . 
While the limited access highway might provide limited traffic relief for people driving back and forth between [LOC Chesterfield] and [LOC Goochland] counties , other people are making choices about where they live and work , 
and they are creating traffic congestion in new places . 
The only thing that surprises me is how rapidly this is happening . 
Even I thought there might be a lag of three or four years . 
If Route 288 has already created a $ 13 million road - construction in just this one exist , think of the liability it has created for all of its exits ! 
Here 's another prodiction : 
After a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of mega-commercial projects at major 288 intersections , the need for new road improvements will soar . 
Before the end of the decade , we may well see the unfunded liability zoom well past the original $ 400 million it took to build the original highway . 
To the brainiacs who thought [ORG Route] 288 was such a great idea : 
Thanks for nothing . 
I think we could have spent the $ 400 million better elsewhere . 
I do n't think you can blame 288 for creating those people . 
If there enough of them to create new traffic congestion in new places , then what is the alternative ? 
Additional traffic congestion in old places ? 
Now you understand how people like [ORG TMT] in [LOC Fairfax] feel . 
I 'd usually take the pro-road position - 
but with the glaring needs in other parts of the state , 288 was definitely excess .. . 
You have a city , [LOC Richmond] , that has virtually no traffic . 
The rush hour is 30 minutes long .. . 
And you give them a beltway through a largely rural area . 
A road to no where .. . 
Just think if this money had been spent on another potomac crossing or road improvements that are desperately needed in [LOC NOVA] ? 
[LOC Virginia] Centrist , To add insult to injury , the rest of the state helped pay for 288 in last year 's budget deal -- wiped the slate clean of debt . 
It was very nice of y'all to oblige us . 
Did n't make much sense , though . 
It 's the same old problem . 
If you get out ahead of the need you are accused of causing sprawl . 
If you build where the need is already acute , then the claim is you ca n't pave your way out of congestion . 
Anonymous - 
That 's a fair point . 
5:26 makes a good point . 
However , this situation hammers home the validity of the state auditor 's report finding that the [ORG CTB] and [ORG VDOT] fail to fund transportation projects based on a comprehensive state transportation plan , but rather , based on whoever does the best job of lobbying . 
I submit that this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated . 
Moreover , Senator [PER Chichester] and his toadies would make this worse by pouring more money into this flawed institution . 
What is the purpose of transportation - related expenditures ? 
In [LOC Virginia] , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest . 
You all are dead wrong . 
No less than [PER Walter Stoch] stated that 288 money was intended to be paid from economic development money . 
Come on folks ! ! 
TMT : I do n't understand your point . 
when was the last time you were stuck in traffic that you were n't on your way to or from some sort of business ? 
It seems to me that the whole point of roads is to facilitate the public interest in getting to and from private businesses . 
Then , of course there is the sunday drive , the trip to grandma 's , and the soccer games , but still , the overwhelming need is to support business . 
Since our road expenditures nowhere near match the increase in business or state domestic product , it is no wonder we suffer congestion problems . 
If we recognize that roads primaarily benefit businesses then we should do two things : 
let business pay for more of our transportation bill , ( which they will pass to us , of course ) and incentivize them to locate where they put the least stress on the system , even if that means more overall travel . 
Why is it so hard to understand ? 
The solution is functional human settlement patterns and a balance between transport system capacity and land use generated travel deman . 
All else is spin . 
EMR 
[ORG TMT] said " In [LOC Virginia] , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest . " 
I do n't see the point of this statement because it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else . 
I think they are so tightly intertwined that they are virtually one and the same . 
Obviously there are local problems because this cookie dough is lumpy , 
but in the aggregate if we demonize business long enough we will eventually find out we all work for the Devil . 
I do n't see there is any point in claiming as " a solution " a balance that is dynamic and ever changing in nature . 
Even you see rail to [LOC Dulles] as a positive because [LOC Dulles] is a job center that promotes bi-directional demand on the rail . 
I agree . 
In fact that may be sufficient reason to build it , all by itself . 
All I 'm saying is that the exact same logic should apply to roads : 
they should have destinations at both ends in order that we get maximum use out of our investment : 
we need more places in order to get closer to the balance you say we need . 
Reality check here - 
I drive past [ORG Watkins Landing] every morning and evening . 
I commute back and forth to work on the [ORG Huguenot Trail] . 
I 've never seen anything remotely resembling a " flood " of traffic . 
It 's a 55 mph zone - 75 to 100 cars in " a morning " - over how much time ? 
The [LOC Huguenot Trail] road widening was already planned , due to the heavy demands of development on the [LOC Chesterfield] side , the new schools , and a whole bunch of existing developments that were zoned years ago and at that time funneled through [LOC Robious Road] . 
288 , for those of us that actually use it , is wonderful - instead of [LOC Powhatan] and [MISC Western] [ORG Chesterfield] being bottlenecked by lack of roads , 
we can actually get some commercial development and have the ability to work closer to where we live . 
You may think that 's not rational land use . 
I have no desire to live in any city , 
I will not work in a downtown area , 
I will not use mass transit , which is not safe for female commuters that work long and irregular hours , 
and I happen to LIKE large lot development . 
How exactly I 'm supposed to keep horses on a 1/4 acre lot is beyond me . 
Gas could go to $ 10 a gallon 
and I 'd still pay to live in the country . 
Many people have legitimate preferences - horses , hunting , gardening , certain types of small business - that makes them NOT want to live in an urban core . 
This infatuation with city living truly baffles me . 
Anonymous 6:37 , You have every right to live in the country if that 's where you wish to live . 
But you do n't have a right to have the rest of the state to underwrite construction of a $ 400 million highway to make it easier to shop and get to work . 
What 's consistently overlooked in the debate ovre 288 is what else that $ 400 million could have been spent on . 
How much traffic congestion could have been alleviated had the money been applied to other pressing road projects or , god forbid , even non-road projects . 
[PER Ray Hyde] - My comments were directed at investors who lobby to place roads near where they own property and the incompetent system that funds these requests without regard to their link or lack thereof to a master transportation plan . 
I am 24 and a mother of a 2 and a half year old . 
[LOC Me] and my son 's father have been broken up since August . 
I want to start dating other people and my son 's father says if I do he will have nothing to do with his son . 
He is very possesive and controlling but he has no right to be as we are not together . 
He has too much going on in his life right now and he thinks we can work when I have told him several times I dont love him and he does not love me . 
I want him to be there for his son without needing me too . 
But he has no one his family and him dont get along and have their own issues . 
I don't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he is around the more miserable I will be . 
I dont want him to not be there for his son as he is a good father or he at least tries . 
I do believe every child needs both parents weather they are together or not . 
But he thinks if he cant have me no one can . 
What do I do to move on with my life . 
Your ex is threatening you using your son... bad , bad , bad . 
You can't give in to that or it will just escalate . 
You have a right to live your own life and be happy , so don't cave to his threats . 
If he really loves his son , he'll see him regardless , but this is just a typical control method that people like him use . 
Others say things like , " I 'm going to kill myself if you leave me " ... get it ? 
Date . 
Meet all kinds of people . 
Do what you want . 
If the price is , he voluntarily walks out of both of your lives , you're probably better off without him . 
I 'd agree - one other thing it is none of his business whether you date or not . 
I wouldn't tell him . 
Not because of his threat - but because your personal life is none of his business . 
Can you document his threats ? 
You really need to . 
Quit taking his calls , make him leave voice mail . 
Make him email or text you . 
Keep those records . 
Get a lawyer and get a divorce . 
If you can't afford one , try legal aid . 
Tell your ex that all communication needs to go through the lawyer . 
The bus drivers want exact change , the till people want exact change , the people who deliver your food want exact change.. . 
Do they not realise that you don't get piles of change from the bank , 
someone somewhere is going to have to take the notes ? 
People are getting lazy . 
I do like to get as near as possible as i woudn't like to be couting coppers all day 
take a £20 note on the bus , they just tell you to get on cos theyre lazy as hell 
its illegal to pay certain amounts in loads of coins . such as you can only pay something like 30pence in 1ps 
Hello I started university in September , didn't immediately gel with it obviously like most people . 
However , I knew it would take me some time to adjust , because I have always been very introverted , and shy and especially anxious and all the rest of it . 
The first night I was here , all my housemates and I went out and it was the hardest thing I have ever ever had to do . 
To go into the [MISC SU] bar on my own , sober . 
Anyways more to the point ; Here are the facts: 
- I am not enjoying university having been here 5months or so ; I 'm disillusioned by the course , not enjoying the projects set , and I don't like the course delivery as much . 
The [ORG University] made out it was much better than it seems . 
- I had a bad start to the first term ; student finance was delayed , adding to my stress levels , I was so worried I was unable to progress with work , conclusively it all piled up . 
- I was assigned a counselor through the university ; had seen her for about 5-6weeks ( block sessions ) , if I 'm honest it didn't really work ; because I was never open with her . 
Only half-halfheartedly . 
- Now the work-load is up to my neck , I have major deadlines to hit , I am depressed , the anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time . 
In no longer have a counselor because you can only have them for so many sessions at a time , and I doubt it will help much this time , if it hasn't already . 
- I lack motivation , don't feel comfortable with any of my lecturers , feel like I want to give in , but can't bring myself to it , because I will end up in a dead end job , and I aspired to 'be someone' . 
- I would rather be dead than not be educated , and live a life I want to live ( and dropping out of uni would make matters worse ) . 
- I 'm 21yrs old ( turn 22 this year ) , don't have much time left for failing need to do something . 
I failed college once over , did another course so I could get to uni don't want to go through the system over and over and consistently fail . 
Can someone please give me some advice please ? 
Perhaps go and see your doctor , and see if there 's any way you can get your deadlines extended to try and ease the pressure a bit ? 
Send your tutors a similar email to this post ( don't worry they 've seen it all before - some much more uncomfortable admissions too - I know as I used to work in a [MISC Uni Dept] admin ) and they will consider mitigating circumstances . 
Break your work into manageable chunks . 
Concentrate on one bit of work at a time ( obvs the most urgent assignment first ) . 
Don't shut yourself off from your housemates , and well done for trying new things from the very beginning now keep at it ! 
I 'd reccomend you go and see your doctor too . 
If you 've always been an anxious person you might benefit from speaking to someone ( my friend got therapy on the [ORG NHS] for anxiety , so its really normal ) . 
And try and get deadlines extended , if you're honest I 'm sure your uni will allow it . 
It 's getting hard to keep strong and keep carrying on with life . 
My mum is getting divorced - she had a horrible time with my step-father and her new found freedom has sent her round the bend . 
She 's epileptic and a manic depressive with a huge anger problem . 
She 's horrible to me , constantly . 
I can't cope with her outbursts and nasty hateful remarks when I 'm at home . 
I 'm 18 , a full-time sixth former at a high pressure private school ( on a 95% bursary ) and I 'm at breaking point . 
I can't do work at home , because she shouts at me . 
So then my teachers get angry at me . 
One minute she 's lovely , and it 's like having my mummy back , then the next , she turns into the most spiteful human alive . 
I 'm not going to pass my A2 exams , I 've already accepted defeat , that this year of my life is going to make me a failure . 
Maybe I can come back from this , who knows . I 've got the most amazing university offers , but I can't even accept them - I'll never make the grades . 
I wish I could wipe her out of my life - things would be so much better without her . 
But then , I think I 'm just being selfish . 
But surely , my life isn't meant to be like this ? 
It should be so much better . B 
ut I feel as if I have no control over this downhill spiral . 
And I don't know what to do . 
Thanks for reading . 
It 's nice to vent . 
You can't get her sectioned for that . 
Does she even have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis ? 
You don't know for sure that you won't get good grades so accept places if you can . 
Life throws **** at you all the time . 
If it 's not someone in your family , it 's an outsider . 
I had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for a long 8 years before I came to uni and honestly , the only reason why I 'm here is because it was the only way out . 
Work hard if you really want out . 
Really sounds like you need support from somewhere else if she can't give it to you consistently . 
You could call Childline or something similar ? 
You could go to the library on saturdays and do a good 8 hours of studying there . 
Is there a friend 's house you could go to- form a study group ? 
So you want her sectioned cos she is a bit of a pain in the arse and you 've blamed all your problems on her ? 
I know what you're feeling . 
My Mum was spat out of hell too . 
I highly recommend taking up smoking 
Oh grow up tsr and stop negging its was a joke ! ! ! 
I think over the last year or 2 i 've become a much weaker person and in a way have dulled down my personality inorder to try and make some friends at uni . 
But being overly-nice to people has lead them to believe that they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me.. . 
they show absolutely no respect . 
e.g. i'll say hello to someone from uni and they'll ignore me , but 30 minutes later they'll decide they want my help with some work... and i'll give it to them . 
It 's causing alot of anger and distress in my life and is really starting to effect my concentration in uni . 
has anyone got any experience in handling this sort of thing or how to go about gaining some respect again ? 
Just say no . 
Do it gradually if it 's not something you're particularly comfortable with . 
You could start with 'No , sorry but I 'm busy' 
Of course , don't go over the top with it lest you go in completely the opposite direction . 
If , in your mind , you're thinking no - say it . 
When they start to realise that you're not going to bend over backwards for them , they'll start respecting you more . 
well this is such a bad attitude really , of course you can be respected if you're nice but not to the point where you just let them do anything to you , that 's not being nice it 's being a fool . 
I don't know if anyone will read this , but I just feel desperate and feel the need to tell someone . 
This September I left home , and started at [LOC University] . I was incredibly anxious about doing this , but rather delayed thinking about it until I got here ! Now I 'm here , and have been for over two weeks , I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward . 
I have been struggling emotionally for the majority of my life since moving to Secondary School , although I did lose my dad at around the age of 9 and always used to blame that for my feelings . I have had two periods of counselling in my life , over roughly 15 months from December 2009 until around March this year . 
I feel at the moment like the problems in my life are incredibly overwhelming , and are making me ever more doubtful of my always low self-esteem . I have no ability to concentrate on work , often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions , and doubt myself over anything and everything . 
Neither of my counsellers have diagnosed me with depression , and both have suggested I do not suffer from it , but it is a huge worry to me , as depression was the cause of my dad 's death , suicide . 
I have tried to solve my problems before , and have found exercise and meditation particularly useful , and have also tried things like self-help books and tapes . But my general feeling , is , 'Is this what my life will be ? My one chance at existance , my one chance of being a young man , I am wasting it ! ' And these feelings are beating away at me . 
I simply don't know what to do , and when I think of things to do , I never follow through with it . Friends often say I 'm lazy , and I can't disagree a lot of the time . I feel like everything anyone could do to help , people have tried , and time and time again I fail . 
Sorry to anyone whose read this jumbled mess , and I feel a bit like a self-seeking moaner , but I truly do feel desperate . 
Its not uncommon for people 's existing feelings about themselves to become more intense when they are in new situations and feel the pressure to socialise with strangers and fit into new roles , i.e. being a university student . 
I am not a health professional and I can only speak from personal experience which is why I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your feelings and worries about depression . 
Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni- you're definitely not alone there . But I would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services . It doesn't really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not , you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support- labels aren't as important as your experiences . Meditation and exercise are really helpful , so definitely try to do those . But yeah , you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere- but don't beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute , lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better . Being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse- be kind to yourself and get some help . 
Good luck . 
I think a lot more people feel the same way as you do , but medicate themselves by using friends . Whilst it probably isn't a 's olution' as such , being around friends whilst being depressed is definitely better than being alone and being depressed . Either way , if you fancy a chat , feel free to PM 
If i were you id focus on an idol . Someone you aspire to ( not want to be them but someone who your admire and have respect for ) e.g. someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful and happy with a family and married etc etc 
Focus on what you want to achieve in life , you havent stated what your studying , or indeed why....is it because you wanted the experience ? Because your mum wanted yo to go ? Because u need a degree for the career you want to do ? 
Either way , sum up why youre there and work your bottom off to get the best grades you can , cos once you get ur degree , you wil have something you can say " hey i didnt fail , it was hard work and i passed "

hope this helps 
I 'm pretty much non-autistic ( not diagnosed with dyspraxia but I think the doctor misdiagnosed ) , but I walk on my toes nearly all of the time . 
It 's more comfortable to me . 
What made them decide toe-walking is a sign of autism since it seems so random and isn't always indicative ? 
Well I might have signs of something on the autism spectrum but who doesn't have one or two ? 
You guys know what I mean . 
Walking on toes can be a symptom of autism . 
Having a headache can be a symptom of brain tumours . 
Feeling tired a lot can be a symptom of leukaemia . 
Symptoms don't always apply but if they happen in a lot of cases ( which it clearly must do in this instance ) it 's worth noting , since otherwise nothing would ever get diagnosed . 
I used to walk on my toes , but that was because I was born with strange toes that curled under and had to be straightened with surgery two years ago . 
My brother 's autistic but I haven't noticed this with him either , but the spectrum is so broad and I myself probably have mild asperger 's because I have problems with communication and don't pick up on social reactions/body language . 
But then I don't have a proper diagnosis and even having some symptoms might not mean you have a certain condition . 
I walk on my toes not as much since years of being told not to . 
I have dyspraxia . 
So maybe you are dyspraxic or have short tendons . 
People who do dance/ gymnastics/ ballet etc have it drilled into them , to the point where I find it more comfortable now =P 
I wouldn't read too much into random " symptoms " like that 
hello , i am a 12 year old girl ( 13 in two days ) who is addicted to self harming 
i started when i was seven as i slit each firnger indevidually with sissors , and from that day i never stopped ,

when i cant find anything to cut with i take around 5 paracetmols and other drugs and i take them with larger and vodka . 
as im writing this i am really tempted to cut my arm or burn myslef , 
i am addicted , when ever one heals i cut again 
it think about it everyday , 
i am 12 and i am already sick of my life . 
the source of this is that ; when i was 7 my dad left , and he doesnt want to know me anymore , 
he just cares about his new little girl and wife , his new life , where im not wanted . 
my best mate died when i was 10 
i had a reltionship with a boy who is 16 and i am forbidden to speak to him because of what happend and the age diffrience 
also my mum suffers from bi polar and i have depression 
i dont what to stop , 
i dont care what i do to myself , i want to do it again and again to tourture myslef , i hate me . 
however , my best mate , i love him , loads , he means the world to me and if i do anything then he will , 
i dont tell him but he finds out , 
i dont want to hurt him , i dont want him to hurt himself 
what do i do 
thanks you for reading 
Are you on any drugs or getting any therapy ? 
It might be an idea to talk to your school nurse or your GP and tell them what 's going on . 
Perhaps there 's a teacher at school who you trust and could tell . 
If you tell people they can help you , 
if you keep it bottled up inside it 's likely to only get worse . 
Trust me , it 's better to get these things as early as possible rather than let them get even worse . 
Please don't do this , 
I 'm 17 I started self harming last year , mainly cutting my arms , but I have stopped since the last few months , 
its hard but you can do it . 
I feel so much happier , but seeing the scars is both a painful reminder of how I felt at that time , how strong my feelings were that I would want to do such a thing to myself ! 
And , also strength , you can do it , I found salvation in poetry writing and keeping a journal , 
self harming is addictive , but you can overcome it , 
remember your self harming does not define who you are . 
You can overcome it . 
So I think Ive got a form of [ORG OCD] because for the past year , I 've found that everytime I go out , especially to Uni , I 'm always checking my belongings to make sure I haven't lost or left anything . 
I often have to check twice at one go , then after 30 seconds for some reason I cant resist checking again ! 
Why is this ! ? 
Am I going crazy or something ? 
It happens most often when I 'm carrying many things , but that is rarely and even still daily I 'm checking many times . And is this OCD to any extent ? 
What can I do about this ? 
If I don't check , I get very very anxious , which does sort of go away after 15-30 mins , but often the anxiety is so much that I can't wait that long . 
I feel if I lost my wallet or phone , then I 'm doomed or so I feel . 
I just wish I could go out without worrying every 2 mins whether I 've left or lost something . 
I really dont know what to do , and am afraid of going to the [MISC GP] . 
They 've probably never heard of some compulsion like this and I just dont know what to do 
Do any of you have a similar 'ritual' ? 
People would think I 'm crazy , but it 's very strangely difficult to get yourself out of this . 
What advice could you give me ? 
I used to do this on my way to college-I had a list of items I knew I had on me and used to check compulsively on the bus . 
I now have more severe anxiety and think this was just a warning sign so just try and wean yourself out of the habit while it 's relatively fresh-definitely visit your doctor but also tell yourself not to keep checking these things ( easier said than done I know ) . 
Doctors will have seen much worse cases so don't worry about that ! 
I did about [ORG OCD] in psycology today :P 
To get rid of it , one way could be just to avoid the compulsive act so don't check to see whether you have lost something , just leave it ( : 
Even though your anxiety levels would increase for a duration , they will gradualy decrease so hopefully , overtime your [ORG OCD] will disappear ( : 
To me that just sounds like you being overly anxious , as opposed to having really bad [ORG OCD] . 
I am very obsessional to the point where I get up 20 times a night to check the locks in my house are all locked a particular way . 
Sometimes although I know they're locked I 'm convinced they're not . 
I think it becomes a real problem when the obsession starts to really interrupt your everyday routine . 
You definitely aren't crazy though don't worry and your [MISC GP] will be understanding of the issue I 'm sure . 
I go to therapy ( for other reasons also ) and they have encouraged me to pick a number of times to check , obviously that is less than 20 , and to stick to it and cut down that way . 
I think the idea is to teach me , I 'm still 'okay' if I check 5 times or 20 times . 
So far I have been a lot better , I think there is definitely hope of improvement for anyone that wants it . 
Usually I 'm pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and not to worry too much . 
However , over the last month or two I 've found myself becoming really anxious about things , and I 'm not talking about a mere out of the blue feeling of nervousness . 
I have begun to feel irrationally panicky about a variety of things which beforehand wouldn't worry me too much or even cross my mind as something to cause alarm bells to ring in my head . 
I 'm not sure if it 's the change in lifestyle ( going from care-free student to unemployed graduate ) that is causing this or if it 's a sign of other issues , but it 's beginning to bug me as it 's affecting my confidence and happiness . 
I 've spoken to a few people about it including my parents but they all think the same: that I 'm going through a random phase and that I should hold off taking action until it is clear that it is a serious problem 
So was wondering what 's the best thing to do ? 
Speak to a doctor about it and see if anti-anxiety pills could take the edge off of things ? 
See if I can speak to a counsellor ? 
Or should I take the advice given by the close people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem ? 
Well I woudnt try to keep an eye on ur anxiety for a start because that will make u tense and more likely to become more panicky ( circle of demise there ) 
what I would try to do is focus on something that is garunteed to make you smile or feel happier as soon as you start to feel a bit panicky about anything . 
Or if u cant do that-when you start to feel panicky , get one of your friends to make you laugh ( it works for me and i suffer from random panic attacks lol 
This started happening to me , where I 'd just start being really anxious over tiny things , although from the sound of things , not as severely as you . 
What I find helps is just talking about what is making you anxious to someone else . 
Perhaps not in a moany way but I found that mentioning the thing that I was worried about to my mum and seeing her react to the situation in a calm way ( like I should have been reacting ) made me feel better about it because I knew it wasn't a big deal and I didn't need to be anxious about it . 
However , if it gets worse , then yes , go to the doctor 's . 
I have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that can prevent her from leaving the house and doing things because she 's so worried about what can go wrong . 
The doctors gave her medication and it 's made her much better .

International ; weapons ; politics ; proliferation ; energy 
The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] reached an agreement with [MISC Iranian] officials that stated there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding [LOC Iran] 's nuclear program and activities . 
[LOC U.S.] and [MISC European] officials suspect that [LOC Iran] 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb . 
[LOC U.S.] and [MISC European] officials suspect that [LOC Iran] 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb . 
[LOC U.S.] and [MISC European] officials may impose a 4th round of sanctions on [LOC Tehran] when the [ORG U.N. Security Council] considers the issue of [LOC Iran] 's nuclear energy program most likely in September 2007 . 
The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] distributed limited copies of the [ORG IAEA] report before a meeting on 11 September 2007 of the 35 members of the [ORG IAEA] board . 
The findings reflect an agency agreement on 21 August 2007 with [LOC Tehran] that [MISC Iranian] officials began publicizing the week of 12 August 2007 . 
The accord said that there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding [LOC Iran] 's nuclear program and activities . 
According to an account by [ORG Reuters] news agency the [ORG IAEA] report said the work plan is a significant step forward . 
[ORG Reuters] quoted a senior [ORG U.N.] official as stating the [MISC Iranian] government 's efforts to enrich uranium had slowed . 
The [ORG IAEA] report stated that [MISC Iranian] officials must continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of [LOC Iran] 's present and future nuclear program . 
[MISC Iranian] officials on 30 August 2007 stated cooperation with the [ORG IAEA] possibly to prevent a further round of international sanctions . 
[LOC Iran] 's representative to the [ORG IAEA] [PER Ali Asghar] SOLTANIEH stated to [LOC Tehran] 's [LOC Fars] news agency that the report emphasized that there exists no sign or evidence indicating diversion of [LOC Iran] 's nuclear activities and that all of [LOC Iran] 's nuclear materials have been audited . 
Some Nonproliferation Experts stated the [ORG IAEA] was ceding too much to [LOC Iran] . 
Arms-control experts [PER David Albright] and [PER Jacqueline Shire] of the [ORG Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security] wrote in a criticism published the week of 19 August 2007 that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that [MISC Iranian] officials would provide the [ORG IAEA] access to key people , facilities , and documents that are needed to verify [MISC Iranian] answers to the [ORG IAEA] 's questions . 
Independent experts stated [LOC Iran] 's latest agreement with the [ORG IAEA] which gives inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of the [LOC West] 's demand to halt the production of concentrated uranium that could potentially be used for a bomb . 
[ORG U.S. State Department] spokesman for the [PER Bush] administration [PER Tom Casey] stated that while the report may offer some new details or insight into the development of [LOC Iran] 's program [MISC Iranian] officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program . 
[PER Casey] stated the fact that the nuclear program continues to move forward shows that the [MISC Iranian] regime is continuing on a path of defiance of the international community . 
Most [MISC Western Nonproliferation] Experts stated the Agreement on 21 August 2007 contained little that could dissuade policymakers in [LOC Washington] , [LOC London] , [LOC Paris] and [LOC Berlin] from moving forward with another round of [ORG Security Council] sanctions . 
Experts stated many of the transparency issues reportedly resolved in the Agreement on 21 August 2007 should have been resolved previously . 
Executive Director of nonpartisan [LOC Washington] think tank the [ORG Arms Control Association] [PER Daryl G. Kimball] stated the agreement does not address the problem that the [MISC Iranian] government is pursuing an enrichment technology and capability that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material . 
[ORG Kimball] stated the [MISC Iranian] government 's design is to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim that progress is being made . 
[MISC Iranian] officials stated a possible reduction in collaboration with inspectors in the event of more sanctions . 
[ORG The Security Council] has voted unanimously to impose sanctions against [LOC Iran] but the penalties have been limited from [LOC U.S.] demands under [MISC Chinese] and [MISC Russian] pressure . 
SOLTANIEH stated in an interview with state-controlled [MISC Iranian] television that the report and the measures taken make the intervention of any other international organization including the [ORG Security Council] irrelevant and unjustified .

[LOC Israel] ( [LOC IL] ) 
proliferation ; technology ; international ; politics 
Documents outlining the [MISC Israeli] proposal to allow the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules were distributed to the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group] . 
The proposal may complicate the [PER Bush] administration 's efforts to win an exemption for [LOC India] to engage in nuclear trade . 
[MISC Israeli] officials convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules . 
[LOC Countries] including [LOC India] , [LOC Israel] and [LOC Pakistan] that have not signed the nuclear [ORG Non-Proliferation Treaty] are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade which includes purchasing reactors , uranium fuel or yellowcake . 
Documents outlining the [MISC Israeli] proposal were distributed to the 45-member [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group] ( [ORG NSG] ) in March 2007 . 
The [MISC Israeli] presentation was made in a nonpaper that allows for official deniability . 
According to a letter from the Chairman of the [LOC NSG] on 17 March 2007 the [MISC Israeli] presentation was offered in the context of the [LOC NSG] 's debate over [MISC Indian] officials' bid for an exemption . 
Among the nations that have not signed the [LOC Treaty] only [LOC India] and [LOC Israel] would qualify for admission to the [ORG NSG] under the [MISC Israeli] proposal . 
The [MISC Israeli] plan offered 12 criteria for allowing nuclear trade with non-treaty states . 
1 criterion indicated [LOC Israel] 's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and said a State should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if the State applies stringent physical protection , control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons , nuclear facilities , source material and special nuclear material in the State 's territory . 
The documents circulated on [LOC Capitol Hill] in September 2007 as the [PER Bush] administration worked toward an agreement with [MISC Indian] officials . 
Executive Director of the [ORG Arms Control Association] in [LOC Washington Daryl Kimball] stated the [MISC Israeli] document could affect the debate over [LOC India] . 
[ORG Kimball] stated -- 
The dynamics at the [LOC NSG] are that officials from the countries do not want to be obstacles to [LOC India] which is the largest country and the [LOC United States] which is the most powerful country . 
Consensus on [LOC India] will be difficult to reach when the [ORG NSG] meets in November 2007 . 
[LOC Israel] 's proposal gives officials from some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to a specific exemption . 
[LOC Israel] 's record is good and better than [LOC India] 's in following international nuclear rules . 
Despite ties between [MISC Israeli] and [LOC U.S.] governments the [ORG Bush Administration] rejected the [MISC Israeli] proposal . 
The proposal may complicate the [PER Bush] administration 's efforts to win an exemption for [LOC India] to engage in nuclear trade . 
President [PER Bush] and Secretary of State [PER Condoleezza Rice] view the Pact as an important part of the [PER Bush] administration 's foreign policy legacy . 
The deal is controversial in [LOC India] and [ORG Congress] must give approval . 
Delays in winning approval for the [LOC India] deal could have a negative effect on the administration 's foreign policy legacy with delay until an election year having the most negative effect . 
[ORG State Department] spokesman [PER Tom Casey] stated the [LOC U.S.] government views the [LOC India] deal as unique and does not see the deal as a precedent for any other country including [LOC Israel] . 
Spokesman for the [MISC Israeli] embassy [PER David Siegel] stated the suggestion that the [MISC Israeli] government is demanding an exemption or linking efforts to any other issue including the [LOC India] debate is grossly inaccurate . 
[PER Seigel] stated -- 
The [MISC Israeli] government has never asked the [ORG NSG] for any exemption to nuclear supply guidelines or made any [MISC Israeli-specific] request of the [ORG NSG] . 
[LOC Israel] is recognized as a full-fledged adherent to the [MISC NSG Guidelines] . 
The [MISC Israeli] government has urged the NSG to consider adopting a generic , multi-tiered , criteria-based approach towards nuclear technology transfers . 
Some officials from NSG countries have previously suggested an approach like the [MISC Israeli] plan . 
If modification of the [MISC NSG Guidelines] were to take place along the lines proposed by [MISC Israeli] officials the nuclear nonproliferation regime would be considerably enhanced .

International ; proliferation 
Ahmadinejad announces expansion of [MISC Iranian] uranium-producing capability . 
[LOC Iran] refuses commitment to halt expansion but hints a possible future halt . 
20080726 [MISC Iranian] President [PER Mahmoud ahmadinejad] stated to scholars in the northeastern city of [LOC mashbad] that [LOC Iran] had expanded its arsenal of centrifuges producing enriched uranium to over 5000 . 
The statement was ahmadinejad 's first asserting an expansion since the 20080400 announcement that [LOC Iran] was approaching the implementation of 6000 centrifuges . 
[LOC Iran] articulated the goal of 50000 centrifuges operating at the enrichment plant near the town of [LOC Natanz] . 
The international community has demanded that [LOC Iran] halt the production of nuclear material . 
Media reports differed on the number of centrifuges ahmadinejad cited . 
An [MISC Iranian] news agency reported that ahmadinejad stated [LOC Iran] had 6000 working centrifuges but the agency subsequently removed the statement from the [MISC Internet] . 
Another [MISC Iranian] news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100000s of centrifuges . 
Experts discounted the significance of ahmadinejad 's claim in the absence of information on the centrifuges' functionality . 
A [MISC Western] diplomat in [LOC Tehran] speaking under condition of anonymity stated that the quantity of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operational and efficient but that ahmadinejad 's assertion will hinder a resolution of the diplomatic standoff between [LOC Iran] and the [LOC West] . 
Arms control expert [PER Jeffrey G. Lewis] of the new [LOC America] [ORG Foundation] think tank stated that the [ORG Foundation] was aware of [LOC Iran] 's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but the operational status of the machines is unknown . 
Diplomats and arms control experts stated that the [MISC Iranian] enrichment program is hindered by technical problems . 
[LOC Iran] has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program aims to produce only electricity because nuclear weapon production contradicts [MISC Islamic] principles . 
The [LOC US] , [LOC Israel] , [LOC Europe] and the majority of [MISC Western] arms control experts believe that [LOC Iran] is pursuing the capability to produce bombs immediately in the event of a decision . 
Experts stated that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple . 
[PER Ahmadinejad] stated that after [LOC Iran] resisted the [LOC West] 's demands for a halt in nuclear activities , the [LOC West] still pursued the resumption of negotiations . 
[ORG EU] foreign policy chief [PER Javier Solana] recently presented [LOC Iran] with 2 offers -- 
A US-endorsed package of incentives to cease enriched uranium production 
A 6-week pre-negotiation' freeze for freeze' period during which [LOC Iran] would add no centrifuges and the [LOC West] would refrain from promoting a 4th round of economic sanctions against [LOC Iran] at the [ORG UN Security Council] . 
[LOC US] officials repeatedly stated that no negotiations can begin before [LOC Iran] verifiably halts all enrichment-related activities but the [PER Bush] administration recently agreed to the' freeze for freeze' proposal and dispatch burns to [LOC Geneva] . 
20080726 during talks in [LOC Geneva] attended by [ORG US Undersecretary of State] [PER William J. Burns] [LOC Iran] refused to respond to [PER Solana] 's offers . 
The talks constituted the highest-level diplomatic contact between the [LOC US] and [LOC Iran] for nearly 30 years . 
[LOC Solana] , burns and [MISC European] envoys set a deadline for [LOC Iran] to respond positively before initiating new sanctions including prohibitions on selling [LOC Iran] refined petroleum products vital to the country 's economy . 
[MISC Iranian] officials refused to commit to stopping expansion or to observe the deadline . 
20080726 ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that [LOC Iran] might potentially halt expansion at a higher number of centrifuges that previously expected and for over 6 weeks . 
[PER Ahmadinejad] stated that the [LOC West] had consented to the existing 5000-6000 centrifuges in operation provided that the number did not increase . 
5000 centrifuges can produce sufficient nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if the material is highly enriched . 
6000 centrifuges running continuously can produce sufficient weapons-grade uranium for 1 bomb in 6 months . 
20080500 the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] stated that [LOC Iran] possessed 3500 centrifuges in operations .

A diplomatic meeting in [LOC Paris] concludes with no agreement on further steps to pressure [LOC Iran] to halt uranium enrichment at [LOC Iran] 's facility in [LOC Natanz] . 
On 081114 diplomats stated to the media that [MISC American] , [MISC European] , [MISC Russian] and [MISC Chinese] officials at a meeting on 081113 in [LOC Paris] did not reach agreement on further actions to persuade [LOC Iran] to halt uranium enrichment at [LOC Iran] 's facility in [LOC Natanz] . 
Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for a nuclear power plant or fissile material for atomic weapons . 
The 081113 meeting ended without any new measures to announce . 
After the 081113 meeting the [MISC French] foreign ministry released a statement declaring the international community had reaffirmed the importance of the dual-track approach of engaging diplomatically with [LOC Iran] and working towards sanctions . 
[LOC Russia] and [LOC China] have resisted new sanctions against [LOC Iran] . 
[LOC Russia] and [LOC China] have close political and business ties with [LOC Iran] and feel no domestic pressure to act against the [LOC Islamic Republic of] [LOC Iran] . 
The [LOC United States] does not have close political and business ties with [LOC Iran] and feels domestic pressure to act against the [LOC Islamic Republic of] [LOC Iran] . 
[LOC Russia] and [LOC China] hold veto power over [ORG Security Council] decisions . 
[LOC Moscow] 's [ORG Interfax] news agency quoted [MISC Russian] diplomat [PER Sergei ryabkov] as stating that the parties struck no deal on sanctions against [LOC Iran] at the 081113 meeting and that the [MISC Western] countries are in favor of the sanctions against [LOC Iran] while [LOC China] and [LOC Russia] did not support sanctions against [LOC Iran] .

[LOC Iran] 's heavy-water research reactor near [LOC Arak] could eventually produce plutonium that might be used in a nuclear weapon . 
Satellite images published by the [ORG Institute for Science and International Security] show construction at the heavy-water research reactor facility near the city of [LOC Arak] has progressed significantly between 080200 and 081000 . 
[PER David Albright] stated that [LOC Iran] 's heavy-water research reactor near [LOC Arak] has evaded the international security community 's notice . 
[PER David Albright] stated that [LOC Iran] 's heavy-water research reactor near [LOC Arak] is making significant progress according to the satellite images and that in a year and a half the heavy-water research reactor near [LOC Arak] has progressed from building frames to a largely finished facility . 
[PER David Albright] is a former arms inspector and Director of the [ORG Institute for Science and International Security] that is based in [LOC Washington] , [LOC D.C.] . 
[LOC Iran] stated that [LOC Iran] is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research . 
The [LOC United States] and its western allies suspect that [LOC Iran] 's efforts to produce is a precursor to creating a nuclear-weapons infrastructure . 
Low-grade uranium production is legal under international arms-control regulations . 
The latest developments in [LOC Iran] 's nuclear technology development show the complex diplomatic and technical challenges facing the incoming foreign policy team of [LOC United States] President-elect [PER Barack Obama] when it takes on the task of stopping [LOC Iran] from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons . 
The administration of [LOC United States] President [PER George W. Bush] in its last months in power has managed to synchronize [LOC United States] policies with the [ORG European Union] , [MISC British] , [MISC French] and [MISC German] leaders , to press for tougher sanctions and diplomatic action against [LOC Iran] . 
The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] is expected to release a report critical of [LOC Iran] next week . 
The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] is the [ORG United Nations] 's nuclear watchdog agency . 
Due to the Act that no new initiatives regarding [LOC Iran] 's nuclear program emerged from the 081113 [LOC Paris] talks the hopes of imposing another set of [ORG United Nations Security Council] sanctions before the end of President [PER Bush] 's term were decreasing . 
While diplomatic maneuvering is taking place [LOC Iran] continues to work towards mastering nuclear and missile technology . 
Some [MISC Israeli] officials have stated their alarm about [LOC Iran] 's test-firing this week of a solid-fuel , two-stage rocket with a range of 1200 miles .

A high-security [MISC Russian] laboratory complex storing anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria faces loosing electricity for lack of payment to the mosenergo electric utility . 
A large repository of anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria stored in a high-security [MISC Russian] laboratory complex 100 miles south of [LOC Moscow] is facing the threat of loosing electricity . 
An official from the [LOC Moscow] region 's mosenergo electric utility arrived recently at the [MISC Russian] laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity for lack of payment . 
The [MISC Russian] laboratory complex is a 90-building campus and served as the location for [LOC Russia] 's secret biological weapons program in the [LOC Soviet] era . 
An incorrect headline in the newspaper [ORG Izvestia] stated that deadly viruses from a [LOC Moscow] regional depository threaten [LOC Moscow] . 
There are no viruses at the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology] in obolensk . 
At the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology there is every kind of deadly bacteria that was studied for use in the secret biological weapons program of the [LOC Soviet Union] . 
A large virus repository is located in [LOC Siberia] . 
Both [MISC Russian] and [MISC Western] officials have stated that it is unlikely that any public health threat would result from a power cutoff at the [ORG State Scientific Center of] applied microbiology . 
[MISC Russian] and [MISC Western] officials have stated that there is enough uncertainty that they could not be positive a loss of power at the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology would not cause a public health threat . 
General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] stated by telephone that the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology has quite reliable systems of protection in case of emergency . 
General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] is the longtime director of the the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology . 
The State scientific center of applied microbiology has been working with [MISC Western] scientists to convert the complex into a biomedical manufacturing site . 
General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] stated by telephone that the people at the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology are scared by this threat of a sudden shutdown of electricity because it is a kind of psychological pressure on the people at the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology . 
General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] stated by telephone that in the event of a power shutdown at the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology scientists must destroy all bacteriological experiments under way . 
General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] would like the [LOC United States] and [MISC Western] countries that have contributed about 6 million [LOC United States] dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapons complex to contribute another 500000 [LOC United States] dollars per year to pay the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology 's electric bills and arrears . 
An [MISC American] scientist who works closely with the [ORG State Scientific Center of] applied microbiology stated that the [MISC Russian] government was responsible for paying for the [ORG State Scientific Center of] applied microbiology 's electric bills . 
[LOC Western] aid for conversion of General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] 's one time bioweapons laboratory peaked in 970000 because it was learned that [LOC Iran] had made offers to the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology to purchase its expertise . 
[MISC Russian] scientists and military leaders who now depend on [MISC Western] financing to destroy nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been known to orchestrate a sense of crisis to increase financing . 
[MISC American] scientist [PER Randall Lee Beatty] is working on the conversion of the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology] in obolensk . 
[PER Beatty] stated that this threat to cut electricity to the [ORG State Scientific Center of] applied microbiology is a crisis . 
[PER Randall Lee Beatty] is a Director of the [ORG International Science and Technology Center] . 
[ORG The International Science and Technology Center] finances approximately half of General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] 's budget to support about 350 [MISC Russian] biowarfare scientists and technicians . 
[PER Randall Lee Beatty] stated that it is known that the [ORG State Scientific Center of] applied microbiology has not paid its electricity bill for 14 months . 
[PER Randall Lee Beatty] stated that the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology is one of the important archives for dangerous pathogens in the world and it would be a shame if those archives were destroyed for not paying the electricity utility . 
Approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology and many of the bacteria are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversize air-handling systems that all depend on electricity to function . 
The greatest danger from a shutdown of electric power at the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology would be the defrosting of live germs that are currently preserved in a frozen state . 
A biological warfare expert at the [ORG Monterey Institute of International Studies] named [PER Raymond zilinskas] stated that the main threat from cutting power to the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied] microbiology would be to the organisms themselves rather than that they might escape . 
[PER Raymond zilinskas] stated that in the worst case the bacteria would be defrosted from minus 70 degrees and it would be a real mess to clean up afterward because it would not be known for certain whether all the bacteria was dead . 
The confrontation between the mosenergo electric utility and the [ORG State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology] in obolensk is another example of how the basic capitalist imperative for enterprises to be self-sustaining can clash in a dangerous way with the old remnants of [LOC Soviet] weapons science . 
Due to an overdue power bill in 000000 the [MISC Russian] [ORG National Power Company] cut off electricity to a strategic base where nuclear missiles stood on high alert . 
The nuclear missile silos themselves did not lose power . 
Armed troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on . 
In 010100 and 010200 the national utility , [MISC United] energy systems cut power to a number of military installations around [LOC Russia] . 
The military installations that lost power included the [MISC Russian] space forces monitoring center on the [ORG Kamchatka Peninsula] . 
In most cases of military installations having their electricity cut off the electricity has been quickly restored . 
Often investigations show that the tug of war with the utility forces the military to spend budgeted funds for electrical power instead of diverting money for other uses . 
Some of the budgeted funds cut at times have included the building country residences for generals .

[LOC Brazil] to implement law allowing air force to target drug trafficking aircraft in [MISC Brazilian] airspace . 
[LOC US] concerned over liability in the event of misidentification of a civilian plane . 
[LOC Brazil] announced that the air force will begin shooting down aircraft used in trafficking illegal drugs in [MISC Brazilian] airspace . 
The plan requires 8 precautionary steps before the order to shoot down a plane may be issued . 
Prior to the policy taking effect late 20041000 a publicity campaign will notify ranchers and others of the need to file flight plans . 
[PER The Law] to permit such an action was originally approved in 1998 but 1995-2003 President [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso] never put the policy into effect . 
The [LOC United States] dissuaded [PER Cardoso] from signing the decree out of concern that the accidental downing of civilian aircraft could expose the [LOC US] government and companies to lawsuits . 
20010400 the [LOC United States] reduced previous support for operations targeting drug-running aircraft when a [MISC Peruvian] jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed an [MISC American] missionary and her child . 
Relatives of the victims sued the [LOC US] government and won a settlement due to the Government 's provision of intelligence and technical support to the operation . 
A [ORG US State Department] official stated -- 
[LOC US] law may forbid assistance to countries that implement shoot-down laws under certain conditions . 
The [LOC US] agrees with the [MISC Brazilian] assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is both very serious and increasing . 
The [LOC US] government has consulted the [MISC Brazilian] Government about the provisions of [LOC US] law . 
[MISC Brazilian] Defense Minister [PER Jose Viegas] stated that [LOC Brazil] has encountered difficulties in securing [LOC US] support for the plan but recent bilateral talks led to certainty that the decree would be accepted by the [LOC US] government without exposing [LOC Brazil] to commercial sanctions . 
[MISC Brazilian] officials have expressed hope that the policy will be endorsed by the [LOC US] before going into effect . 
The [LOC US] is scheduled to provide 10.2 million dollars in drug and law enforcement aid to [LOC Brazil] in 2004 . 
Former air force chief and current Director of the [ORG Air Institute] at [ORG estacio de sa University] in [LOC Rio de Janeiro] General [PER Mauro Jose Miranda] gandra stated that the measure was a courageous step by the Government but the impact may be more political than practical because of self-imposed restrictions by the [MISC Brazilian] government . 
[MISC Brazilian] officials stated that the policy would be inapplicable against aircraft with children on board . 
Viegas stated that the limitation was necessary . 
[LOC Gandra] stated that the provision undermines the decree 's essential purpose by granting immunity to drug-smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of kidnapped children being used as human shields . 
Viegas stated in an interview in [LOC Brasilia] that the government will use the law to more powerfully dissuade drug traffickers who have previously entered [MISC Brazilian] airspace feeling unthreatened by the air force . 
The Government was prompted to act due to the deteriorating public security situation with increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in [LOC Sao Paolo] and particularly [LOC Rio de Janeiro] . 
[LOC Rio de Janeiro] drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close . 
President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva] stated in a 2003 interview with foreign correspondents -- 
The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security . 
Some pilots of drug-running aircraft felt so confidently immune from retribution as to make obscene gestures at pursuing [MISC Brazilian] air force pilots . 
The constitutionality of the law has been questioned under [LOC Brazil] 's prohibition of the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts . 
Some legal experts and other commentators stated that contrary to government claims , the Statute amounts to a de facto execution of drug traffickers . 
The daily newspaper [LOC O Estado de Sao Paolo] stated in an editorial the week of 20040718-20040824 -- the extreme measure raises ethical and juridical problems exceeding any potential benefits . 
The penalty will be applied extrajudicially by administrative decision of the Commander of the [ORG Air Force] . 
This person will gain life and death power over crew members and passengers of irregular flights . 
In 2002 [LOC Brazil] inaugurated the 1.4 billion dollar SIVAM radar system allowing the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive [LOC Amazon] region for the first time . 
The system uses [MISC American] technology . 
Illegal Flights initially declined 30 percent due to trafficker 's concerns about improved tracking capabilities but subsequently reaccelerated . 
[LOC Brazil] recorded 4128 unauthorized flights in 2003 . 
Some of these flights were innocent violations by ranchers in the [LOC Amazon] flying between plantations . 
Viegas stated that there was a significant increase in deliberate violations of [MISC Brazilian] airspace , apparently by drug smugglers realizing that the government was incapable of retaliation . 
20010400 [LOC Rio de Janeiro] 's most notorious drug boss , [PER Fernandinho Beira-Mar] , was captured in [LOC Colombia] in a guns-for drugs pipeline involving left-wing guerrillas . 
[LOC Brazil] 's northern Amazon corridor has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and is used for smuggling arms , gold and diamonds . 
Reportedly one of the most important drug- and gun-smuggling routes in supplying [LOC Europe] with cocaine runs from [LOC Colombia] across the northern tier of the [LOC Amazon] to [LOC Suriname] . 
[LOC Colombia] is the only country that currently has a policy of targeting drug trafficking aircraft .

[MISC Venezuelan] president [PER Hugo Chavez] 's weapons deals with [LOC Russia] , curbs on military cooperation with the [LOC United States] , and plans to train as many as 2 million [MISC Venezuelan] civilians to repel a possible invasion by imperialist superpowers have the [LOC United States] and [PER Chavez] 's domestic critics worried about what the leftist former military officer is planning . 
[PER Chavez] insists that the moves are purely defensive and born of an overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect [LOC Venezuela] from nations that might want to take control of [LOC Venezuela] . 
[LOC Venezuela] is [LOC South America] 's largest petroleum-producing state . 
[PER Chavez] 's domestic opponents scoff at the idea that the [LOC US] would ever invade [LOC Venezuela] and charge that [PER Chavez] 's true intention is to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists who would protect [PER Chavez] against any internal uprising and to pose as a militarized counterweight to [LOC US] influence in [LOC Latin America] . 
[MISC Cuban] leader [PER Fidel Castro] is [PER Chavez] 's his major ally and [PER Chavez] is growing closer [PER to Castro] . 
[PER Chavez] 's detractors in the [LOC US] government say that it is even more troubling that [PER Chavez] 's arms purchases and indoctrination of civilian militias could be part of a strategy to restructure [MISC Venezuelan] democracy in the image of [MISC Cuban-style] militarized socialism and foment leftist revolutions throughout [LOC South America] . 
[LOC US] military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that radical movements inspired by [PER Chavez] could foment such revolution . 
The political mainstream in [LOC Latin America] has shifted leftward since the late 1990s . 
This leftward shift is largely in reaction to the perceived failure of free-market economics . 
Leftists have been elected to lead [LOC Brazil] , [LOC Argentina] , [LOC Chile] , [LOC Uruguay] , [LOC Ecuador] and [LOC Venezuela] . 
[PER Chavez] 's supporters at home counter that the [LOC United States] has a century-long history of open as well as covert armed intervention in [LOC Latin America] 's domestic politics and say that it has no right to question [LOC Venezuela] 's defense preparations . 
[PER Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon] said that [MISC Venezuelans] never ask what the [ORG US Marines] are doing . 
[PER Espinoza Leon] is a pro-Chavez defense specialist who serves in [LOC Venezuela] 's [ORG National Assembly] . 
[PER Espinoza] said that [LOC Peru] has 500000 rifles and no one says anything . 
[PER Espinoza] said no one complains that [LOC Colombia] is the most militarized country in [LOC Latin America] . 
[PER Espinoza] said [LOC US] history is full of aggression in [LOC Latin America] . 
[PER Espinoza] said [MISC Venezuelans] have to do whatever is necessary to protect [LOC Venezuela] . 
[PER Chavez] has famously said that the [MISC Venezuelan] so-called [MISC Bolivarian] revolution is peaceful but not unarmed . 
[PER Chavez] was first elected in 980000 and has a popularity rating of 71 percent in an independent poll by polling firm [ORG Datanalisis] . 
[MISC Venezuelan] military analyst [PER Alberto Garrido] said [PER Chavez] is looking for allies in [LOC Russia] , [LOC China] , and [LOC Iran] in order to promote a multi-polar world which will counteract [LOC US] dominance and encourage grassroots Movements in [LOC Latin America] to throw off [LOC US] governmental influence . 
[PER Lorenzo Campos] is a farmer in [LOC Anzoategui] state in northern [LOC Venezuela] and is training as a reservist . 
[ORG Campos] said [MISC Venezuelans] want the world to know that [MISC Venezuelans] are not preparing to attack anyone and that the mission is to protect [LOC Venezuela] . 
In May , [PER Chavez] 's government announced details in 050500 of an $18.6 million deal with a [MISC Russian] firm to purchase 100000 [MISC AK-103] assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each and the technology transfer for [LOC Venezuela] to manufacture the rifles . 
The deal works out to $186.22 per rifle . 
This price is considerably less costly than the [LOC US] mail-order price of $825 to $850 for the same weapon . 
The Government of [LOC Venezuela] also intends to buy 10 [MISC Russian] helicopters , 10 [MISC Spanish] transport planes , and 6 [MISC Spanish] naval craft . 
[MISC Venezuelan] officials say the government is negotiating with [LOC Brazil] to buy around 24 air support and training planes . 
[PER Chavez] has insisted and even his staunchest retired military Critics here agree that the purchases are essential to update old weaponry such as the military 's decades-old [MISC Belgian] FAL rifles . 
Retired General [PER Fernando OCHOA ANTICH] said that it is an exaggeration to say [PER Chavez] is engaged in an arms buildup . 
[PER Ochoa] was defense minister in 920000 when then-Lieutenant Colonel [PER Chavez] launched a failed coup . 
[PER Ochoa] stated that [LOC Venezuela] hasn't purchased arms in 25 years and said and [PER Chavez] is not aggressively buying weapons in a way that would threaten his neighbors . 
[PER Ochoa] said [LOC Venezuela] has never bought [MISC Russian] arms before and suggested [PER Chavez] is doing it to become independent from the [LOC US] . 
[PER Ochoa] asked why [PER Chavez] is buying a caliber of rifle which is popular among subversive forces in [LOC Latin America] and stated that the political support [PER Chavez] gives to radical leftist movements makes [PER Chavez] a continental menace . 
The [ORG US Pentagon] has openly questioned what [PER Chavez] will do with the old [ORG FAL] rifles and whether [PER Chavez] might share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in [LOC Latin America] . 
The [LOC US] government has provided no evidence of [PER Chavez] arming or funding leftist insurgencies . 
Military analysts and specialists on the [MISC Colombian] [ORG FARC] guerrillas say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and would not be interested in old [MISC Belgian] rifles or in assistance from [PER Chavez] . 
A 030000 study published by the [ORG US] [ORG Defense Intelligence Agency] reported that more than half of the weapons seized from [MISC Colombian] guerrillas from 980000 to 010000 that had markings of foreign militaries were of [MISC Venezuelan] origin . 
The implication was that corrupt or sympathetic members of the [MISC Venezuelan] military may be aiding guerrillas . 
Perhaps more distressing to [PER Chavez] 's domestic opponents is the ideological training that critics say [PER Chavez] has in mind for the military and for new civilian reservists . 
[PER Chavez] called earlier in 050000 for so-called Revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist a superpower aggressor and said the first step would be to train from 100000 to 2 million volunteers in the coming years to back up active-duty armed forces . 
Military analysts estimate [LOC Venezuela] 's active-duty armed forces number 83,000 . 
People 's defense units would be created in neighborhoods , State companies , and the [ORG Free University] established under [PER Chavez] and would report directly to the president . 
The government insists the reserves will support the armed forces and not act as a fifth column against a possible anti-Chavez coup . 
[PER Espinoza] said the reserves are not to be used as shock troops for any political party and that if there were a civil war , it would be up to each person to take their own side . 
General [PER Julio Ramon Quintero] viloria is commander of the reserves . 
[PER Quintero] said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50000 civilians over 20 weekends in the second half of 050000 and could train 300000 more in 060000 . 
[PER Quintero] said that [MISC Venezuelans] don't want to be the colony of any empire and have to be ready for any possibility . 
100000 reservists in 050600 engaged with the [MISC Venezuelan] navy in a massive war game to repel a stronger country that had invaded . 
40 employees of the state oil company participated in a similar exercise with 1200 soldiers in 050600 . 
Pro-Chavez circles here warn of asymmetrical warfare . 
Asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by [LOC US] military strategists to describe a conflict between unequal combatants where the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics . 
The [LOC US] government has given $3.3 billion in mostly military aid to [LOC Colombia] in the past 5 years . 
[PER Chavez] loyalists fear that the [LOC US] government could instigate a proxy war between [LOC Colombia] and [LOC Venezuela] as a way to oust [PER Chavez] and control [MISC Venezuelan] oil . 
A senior [LOC US] official in an interview dismissed the notion that the [LOC United States] Government wants to invade [LOC Venezuela] as complete and utter nonsense . 
The official said the chavista side wishes to make the relationship negative because they 've made a political calculation that Mr. [PER Chavez] reached power by constantly being in confrontation with the [LOC US] . 
Another development that has troubled the [LOC United States] is [PER Chavez] 's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises . 
The [LOC US] military had a [ORG Cooperation Office] for 50 years in a [MISC Venezuelan] Fort . 
[PER Chavez] shut it down in 040000 . 
5 [LOC US] military trainers and students participating in an exchange program were ordered to leave the country in 050400 . 
Analysts say that it is likely [PER Chavez] is trying to indoctrinate his public and armed forces . 
Analysts say that there is no proof that [PER Chavez] will use those forces to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere .

The [MISC North Korean] government may be prepared to begin shutting down a plutonium producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step toward disabling the Unit by December 2007 . 
Assistant Secretary of State [PER Christopher Hill] stated on 18 June 2007 that the [MISC North Korean] government may be prepared to begin shutting down a plutonium producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step toward disabling the Unit by December 2007 . 
[PER Hill] is the head [MISC American] negotiator on [LOC North Korea] 's nuclear weapons program . 
[PER Hill] stated stalled efforts to dismantle [LOC North Korea] 's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of 16 June 2007 and 17 June 2007 when [LOC Pyongyang] officials invited inspectors from the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] to visit for talks on verifying and monitoring a shutdown . 
Following talks with [MISC Chinese] negotiator [PER Wu Dawei] Hill stated the shutdown has long been anticipated . 
[PER Hill] stated the shutdown could occur in a matter of weeks not months . 
The [ORG Associated Press] reported from [LOC Vienna] , [LOC Austria] that the [ORG IAEA] stated on 18 June 2007 that a team would visit [LOC Pyongyang] the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors will verify the shutdown . 
[PER Hill] stated [ORG IAEA] inspectors will hold talks with [LOC Pyongyang] officials on sealing the reactor which would include the installation of television monitors at the site . 
[MISC North Korean] officials refused to proceed with a February 2007 agreement to begin decommissioning the [LOC Yongbyon] reactor until funds worth 25 million dollars in accounts linked to [LOC North Korea] held in a [LOC Macao] Bank were transferred to [LOC North Korea] . 
The money was frozen when officials from the [LOC United States] accused the [ORG Banco Delta Asia] of complicity in financial crimes on behalf of [LOC North Korea] . 
The funds were wired on 14 June 2007 to the [LOC New York] [ORG Federal Reserve Bank] after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds . 
The funds were to be sent to [LOC Russia] 's [ORG Central Bank] before a transfer to an account controlled by the [LOC North Korea] government in a [MISC Russian] commercial bank . 
[PER Hill] stated talks will occur the week of 17 June 2007 with disarmament negotiators from [LOC Russia] , [LOC South Korea] and [LOC Japan] on steps to recoup some of the time lost while the financial transfer was being organized . 
The discussions will also involve setting a timetable for resumption of 6-nation arms control talks . 
Under the agreement reached in February 2007 [MISC North Korean] officials pledged to shut down the [LOC Yongbyon] reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a 50000-ton shipment of fuel oil . 
[MISC North Korean] officials will declare all nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950000 tons of fuel oil in the next phase of the Agreement . 
[PER Hill] stated the technical possibility of concluding the next phase of the agreement by December 2007 .

The official website of [LOC Iraq] 's [MISC Shiite] leader the [PER Grand Ayatollah] [PER Ali al-Sistani] was among the websites defaced and blocked .

The official website of [LOC Iraq] 's [MISC Shiite] religious leader the [PER Grand Ayatollah] [PER Ali al-Sistani] was defaced and blocked in a sectarian-motivated cyber attack on Shiite-related sites . 
It was not clear whether the attack began on 18 September 2008 or the morning of 19 September 2008 . 
By the evening of 19 September 2008 [PER Al-Sistani] 's website was offline . 
Another website related to 1 of [PER Al-Sistani] 's religious organizations , www.al-shia.com , was also affected . 
An alternative address , www.sistani.com , was still operational . 
[ORG Iranian News Agency] [LOC Fars] stated that group [ORG XP] had blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite-related sites on 18 September 2008 and 19 September 2008 . 
Neither the hacking claim nor an [MISC Iranian] assertion that group [ORG XP] was based in the [LOC United Arab Emirates] could be verified independently . 
Several [MISC Iranian] news sites stated on 19 September 2008 that many of the [MISC Shiite] and [MISC Iran-related] web sites that had been attacked were running normally again . 
A statement signed group [ORG XP] was posted on the home page of [PER Al-Sistani] 's web site and stated that the attack was on behalf of [MISC Sunni] Muslims . 
The statement said -- 
Group XP had carried out similar attacks on other [MISC Shiite] sites in the [MISC Persian] [LOC Gulf] and [LOC Iraq] . 
Group [ORG XP] erased the site as group [ORG XP] has done with other Rafidha sites .

[MISC Somali] pirates who hijacked a [MISC Ukrainian] freighter carrying a large cargo of arms are approaching a deal for the ship 's release . 
Questions have emerged regarding the shipment of arms en route to [LOC Kenya] and of a possible clandestine arms deal between [LOC Kenya] and [LOC South Sudan] . 
On 08 October 2008 Maritime officials and associates of the [MISC Somali] pirates who on 25 September 2008 hijacked a [MISC Ukrainian] freighter carrying a large cargo of arms stated that the pirates may soon be collecting their ransom . 
After difficult negotiations likened by several people involved to bazaar-style haggling the parties are close to reaching a deal in which the pirates would be paid millions of dollars and the ship freed . 
A businessman in xarardheere , [LOC Somalia] named [PER Ahmed Omar] stated that the pirates and the ship owners have agreed on a ransom of approximately 8 million [LOC U.S.] dollars and the ship may be freed on 08 October 2008 or 09 October 2008 . 
Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on the coast of [LOC Somalia] . 
Maritime officials in [LOC Kenya] stated that critical details have yet to be agreed upon . 
One such detail involves the pirates' request for a guarantee that they would not be arrested or attacked by the armada of [MISC American] warships currently encircling them . 
A [MISC Kenyan] maritime official stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than the financial aspect . 
On 08 October 2008 the official stated that progress is being made and the parties are approaching an agreement . 
The pirates initially requested 35 million [LOC U.S.] dollars and then reduced their request to 20 million [LOC U.S.] dollars . 
The pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate the financial figures . 
More than 25 ships have been hijacked in 2008 off the [LOC Somalia] coast with a typical ransom of between 1 and 2 million [LOC U.S.] dollars . 
The pirates aboard the [MISC Ukrainian] ship have stated that upon receipt of payment in [MISC American] dollars and preferably in 100 dollar bills the ship , its cargo and the 20 sailors on board will be released . 
The original country of destination for the arms shipment aboard the [MISC Ukrainian] ship is being questioned . 
Shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 September 2008 the [MISC Kenyan] government claimed that the weapons on board were being shipped for [LOC Kenya] 's military . 
The ship was en route to [LOC Kenya] 's main port of [LOC Mombasa] . 
The weapons on board the ship included 33 T-72 tanks , 150 grenade launchers , 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition . 
Evidence has subsequently emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between [LOC Kenya] and the separatist region of southern [LOC Sudan] . 
The deal would most likely have remained secret had the pirates not hijacked the ship and begun speaking to the media by satellite phone . 
[MISC Ukrainian] officials have been adamant in denying any wrongdoing . 
[MISC Ukrainian] diplomat in [LOC Kenya] oleh belokolos stated -- 
[LOC Ukraine] does not supply or have plans to supply any armaments to the [ORG Government of South Sudan] . 
All the appropriate paperwork has been validated . 
[LOC Ukraine] abides by all [ORG United Nations] rules and arms control agreements . 
[LOC Ukraine] inherited enormous stockpiles of weaponry after the collapse of the [LOC Soviet Union] and is now a major arms dealer . 
The deal with [LOC Ukraine] is considered suspicious given that [LOC Kenya] has mostly relied on the [LOC United Kingdom] and other western countries for its supply of heavy weapons . 
[MISC Kenyan] politicians were demanding answers and have called for several commissions to examine the situation . 
[LOC Southern Sudan] is an autonomous region that is currently increasing its military and that uses Soviet-designed tanks . 
[LOC The] [MISC American] military stated that its priority is to ensure that the weapons were not unloaded from the ship and sold to [MISC Islamist] insurgents in [LOC Somalia] . 
The pirates have denied interest in the weapons and claimed to have been unaware that the cargo included tanks when they hijacked the ship . 
Pirate spokesman [PER sugule Ali] stated in an interview last week that the pirates' sole interest in the deal is money .

Head of the [ORG U.N.] drug office [PER Antonio Maria Costa] said that [LOC Afghanistan] has produced so much opium in recent years that the [ORG Taliban] are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency . 
Head of the [ORG U.N.] drug office [PER Antonio Maria Costa] said that [LOC Afghanistan] has produced so much opium in recent years that the [ORG Taliban] are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency . 
[ORG Costa] said this to reporters last week as the [ORG U.N. Drug Office Office] prepared to release its latest survey of [LOC Afghanistan] 's opium crop . 
The survey showed that poppy cultivation had retreated in much of [LOC Afghanistan] and was overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong , most of those in the south . 
The survey was issued November 27 , 2008 . 
The [ORG United Nations] found that the result was a 19 percent reduction in the amount of land devoted to opium in [LOC Afghanistan] even though the total tonnage of opium produced dropped by just 6 percent . 
The study stated that the high output per acre was attributed to a good growing season in the south . 
The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the [ORG Taliban] maintained a strong presence in 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation as a way to finance their insurgency for several years . 
The [ORG U.N.] estimates the insurgents made as much as 300 million dollars from the opium trade last year . 
[LOC Costa] said a lot of war effort can be funded with 2 to 300 million dollars . 
The [ORG Taliban] have producing an amount of opium that far exceeds world demand due to 3 successive years of bumper crops . 
[ORG Costa] said the result was a glut that was depressing the price , which dropped by approximately 20 percent . 
[LOC Costa] said that the fact that prices had not collapsed already was evidence that the [ORG Taliban] , drug lords and even some farmers have stockpiled the opium . 
An increasing amount is also being processed in [LOC Afghanistan] . 
[LOC Costa] added that insurgents have been holding significant amounts of opium . 
[ORG Costa] said the surplus is as much as 11000 tons , or more than twice world demand in the last 3 years and threatened to devalue their stockpiles . 
The [ORG United Nations] found that [LOC Afghanistan] produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008 . 
World demand was estimated at about 4400 tons per year . 
The [ORG Taliban] this year are taking a passive stance toward cultivation and putting less pressure on [MISC Afghan] farmers to plant opium poppy . 
This then supports the current price . 
[LOC Costa] is an [MISC Italian] diplomat who has served at the [ORG U.N. Office] on Drugs and Crime for 6 years .
