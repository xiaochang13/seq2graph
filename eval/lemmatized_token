gadhafi attack us in speech in italy
rome 2009 @-@ 06 @-@ 11 13 @:@ 34 @:@ 38 utc
libyan leader moammar gadhafi on thursday urge the world to understand what motivate terrorist , and likened the 1986 u.s. strike on libya to osama bin laden 's terror attack .
gadhafi , who be long accuse of sponsor terrorism , get tepid applause from the italian lawmakers he address on the second day of a trip to italy , libya 's former colonial ruler .
" it be not very intelligent to chase terrorist down the afghan mountain or central asia , " gadhafi say in the hour @-@ long speech .
" that 's impossible .
we must look at their reason ."
he call for dialogue with terrorist , say , " one must talk to the devil , if it bring about a solution ."
sarcastically , he ask , " what 's the difference between the u.s. airstrikes on our home and bin laden 's action ? "
if anything , he say , bin laden be an outlaw , while the unite state be a country that should abide by international law .
former president ronald reagan order airstrikes on tripoli and benghazi in april 1986 after an attack on a disco in germany kill three people , include two u.s. servicemen .
the libyans say the retaliatory attack kill 41 people , include gadhafi 's adopt daughter , and injure 226 others .
the libyan leader tell the lawmakers he be be intentionally provocative " in order to try and understand act of terrorism ."
gadhafi have long be ostracize by the west for sponsor terrorism , but in recent year seek to emerge from his pariah status by abandon weapon of mass destruction and renounce terrorism in 2003 .
libya have since agree to pay compensation to the family of the berlin disco victim as well as the family of the victim of the 1988 pan am 103 bomb over lockerbie , scotland , which kill 270 people , include 189 americans .
libyan abdel basset ali al @-@ megrahi be convict of blow up the plane .
the unite state restore diplomatic tie with libya in 2006 and remove the north african nation from the state department list of country that sponsor terrorism .
gadhafi 's visit to italy continue that process of emergence from international isolation .
but it also draw protest , include at la sapienza university , where gadhafi be address a group of few hundred student .
the speech to lawmakers be likely to raise more controversy .
he have be set to speak inside the italian senate , a rare honor for visit dignitary .
but opposition lawmakers balk , forcing the speech to be move to a palazzo next door .
enrico morando , a senator of the opposition democratic party , say gadhafi 's presence at the senate would have be a " humiliation of this country 's democratic and republican spirit ."
" only those who have the credentials _ in term of democracy and protection of human right _ be entitle to speak to parliament , the inviolable temple of democracy , " he tell la repubblica newspaper .
human right organization and other critic have also denounce a recent deal that allow italy to send immigrant back to libya if they be intercept at sea .
they also decry libya 's treatment of the migrant and its poor human right record .

texas have the most hard core criminal justice system in the country .
be it a possibility there be another side to this ?
be it a possibility that this young man and his friend do not rape this girl ?
be it a possibility abc news have blow this out of proportion , twist and distort the fact ?
texas criminal court and prosecutor do not coddle to anyone .
the football argument be an old one , not happen these day .
player these day get 4 game suspension for sell a t shirt on e @-@ bay .
i 'd never hear of this case until now .
so , i googled it to get more information .
even the information that be available be fuzzy .
but it appear the prosecution struck a deal because of a lack of evidence .
it seem the prosecutor be say that everyone involve be drunk @/@ drink and that the story tell have hole in them.......
all of them .
hence , the ' slap on the wrist '.
i 'm all for women @/@ girl be able to do everything they want , in theory .
however , the reality of the situation be that 16 year old girl should not place themselves in situation like this ( drink to apparent excess ) while at a party not chaperon by an adult .
that say , young men should also not put themselves in that exact same situation because if you can n't recount accurately what happen because you be drunk , you cannot say for sure what do or do not happen .
as for the race angle , it be unecessary .
this would have be no better or worse have the accuse kid be white .
bingo
why must we make this a race issue ?
really ?
it 's a horrible thing that happen .
well then , why be it a hate crime when a white person do it to a black but not a hate crime when it 's the other way around ?
i do n't think it be a race issue either .
they need to throw these punk in jail !
although you do make a good point that it 's only a hate crime if a white person pick on a black person .
if it 's the other way around it 's no big deal for some reason .
if she be my daughter , those 2 punk that rape her would be find one day after football practice in a ditch with a bullet in their head .
amen ! !!!
because post racial america be show itself...
the same people who do n't not like obama because of his race post this kind of crap .
you be an idiot .
i do n't like obama because he be a socialist pig .
if the perps be black they be still guilty .
i be tired of thug cry that they get in trouble just because they be black and that society make them do it , bull ! !!!
they be thug and deserve a bullet .
they should have be expel from school at a minimum .
i guess you know the whole story and can make that objective assessment ?
you need to learn the definition of socialist , then readjust your priority .
nevertheless , the whole stereotype you describe be complete bullshit .
nope .
was n't there .
my opinion be based on the information provide .
welcome to a message board .
funny you should say that .
a cousin of mine be rape a long time ago , the guy that do it commit suicide shortly after - blew his own head off with a shotgun .
big question !
why the hell do guy rape women anyway ?
women be horny as hell !
all you have to do be be nice to them and they 'll pretty much accomodate you in any way you want .
yes , sometimes you have to give them time to think about it....
besides which sex with women that be voluntarily engage be an awful lot better .
young guy need a talkin ' to...
a talk to ?
how about jail ?
16 year old girl do not consent to gang rape .
no matter how " horny " or drunk they be .
please tell me you 're not speak from experience .
you have to understand that in texas , football be king and good football player be god who can do no wrong .
worse than this have be sweep under the rug for hs and college football star there .
no , i do n't have to understand .
why be the title of your thread so insidious ?
why not a title lie " school official screw over rape victim ? "
that one would be more accurate .
because this be not your thread to name .
work for me .
and that question was n't direct at you .
still do n't bend reality now do it ?
not only do 4 black rape this girl , the main perp only receive anger management class with no jail time !
the girl be just 16 , a cheerleader at silsbee high school in texas .
she be at a party in 2008 when football star rakheem bolton , fellow player christian roundtree and another boy push her into a bedroom and lock the door , hold her down , and sexually assault her...
when others try to enter the room , bolton and roundtree jump out a window , leave their clothe behind .
the girl file charge , but that do n't put an end to her trauma .
sphincteric school superintendent richard bain jr . would make sure it only get worse .
when the girl return to school , administrator decide the best course of action be for the girl to slink away in a corner and try not to be see .
they tell her to avoid the cafeteria and not take part in homecoming .
out of sight , out of mind .
the kid be all teenager , and the sex be claim to be consensual .
i have no idea whether it be , and neither do anyone of this forum .
that remain to be see .
so yes , the title of this thread do kind of bend reality .
labour be a left wing socialist party .
they be pro immigration if it support the economy and believe in equal right for all individual .
they be traditionally more likely and be know for allow immigrant into the country - hence they be his target .
the labour party be responsible for the current state of immigration in the country , and in his own ideology , he want to take our future labour politician ( which those in the camp be potentially ) from get into power and allow more in .
in his mind , by take them out , he can prevent future immigration .
can n't believe it , norway be such a friendly quiet country , this guy must be nut they dont even have that many migrant , at least not compare to uk !
he basically hate islam and believe that islamic immigration be a huge threat to europe .
he think that european politician be allow the colonisation of europe by muslims and so be all legitimate target .
he think we need to deport all muslims from europe turkey north iran and palestine .
he attack his own kind because kill muslims would lead to them be replace by more muslims .
so instead he decide to take out " the next generation of left wing seed ".
in short he have wipe out a number of potential future left wing politician .
he also see himself a bit like a templar knight defend christianity from islam
this .
he be n't a white supremacist though .
this be a bit of a myth . oslo be a hugely multicultural and as far as i 'm aware , norway as a whole be about on par with the uk in term of different ethnic group .
it 's a myth british people seem to have that the uk be one of the most multicultural place in europe , when in reality sweden , the netherlands and possibly norway be notably more so .
i 'm not a fan of david cameron .
thank to his government , i 'll likely be pay 3x as much as i would for university .
i vote labour yesterday , i be a labour party member , with scottish root .
however , david cameron *does* have a say , as do i , as do all of us , on whether we want the union to remain .
david cameron be the prime minister of the unite kingdom .
he have every right , and indeed , it should be his job to defend and persuade the scottish electorate and population that the unite kingdom should remain , that scotland should vote no to any such referendum .
i would vote no .
the world be change , with a strengthen east and a weaken west .
if the uk be to split , we would all become weaken .
i agree , scottish independence be a matter for the scots , and should they vote for it , then that vote should be respect .
but , personally , i believe rather than a breakup , the union should be reform , so there be equality for all the nation .
bit of an off point - but i 'll just say the ' west lothian ' question and leave you with that .
you argue that david cameron should not be able to ' poke his big nose in ' to the idea of scottish independence - yet , scottish mps be able to do just that when certain english affair be debate in westminster ( something english mps be not able to do with scottish affair ) .
this be why there should be an appetite for reform within the union - not a messy divorce that will leave us weaken , not strengthen .
i do n't agree that scottish should have a voice in westminster concern england @-@ only matter .
indeed , it would be far more pragmatic if we devolved the entire union -@ a parliament for every 5 or 10 million people in england perhaps ?
( north/midlands/london/south east/west ? )
i 'm sure there would n't be as much appetite for independence north of the border if the scots feel that they be n't subordinate to a parliament situate hundred of mile away that do n't really represent them ( holyrood be overwhelmingly full of centre @-@ leave msps , yet we effectively have a centre right majority government in westminster ) .
i 'm not necessarily for or against independence .
i have n't really read into it enough to decide .
i fully support the decision to go independent though , if that be the outcome of the referendum , just as i would support the decision to remain in the union .
i 'm not polish .
that be my point .
my grandfather settle in the falkirk area of scotland after the second world war ( have serve alongside british arm force during the liberation of europe ) .
i have polish ancestry , the same way cameron have scottish ancestry .
the idea that cameron 's ancestry should entitle him to vote on matter concern the scottish parliament be as ludicrous as my ancestry entitle me to vote in the polish sejm .
the argument that since cameron be the prime minister of the uk , he should have a voice be more legitimate , but it be not an argument i agree with .
and if brittany wish to split , that be an issue for those live in brittany .
if sarkozy be n't from brittany , then his only job should be in ensure that the split occur legally .
the argument that the whole of the uk should vote on scotland 's independence be like say the whole of the eu should get to vote if the uk ever hold an in @/@ out eu membership referendum .
it 's completely absurd and there 's no justification for it .
and what 's to say scotland will go bankrupt ?
iceland , norway , denmark , finland , austria , switzerland , lithuania , estonia , latvia and ireland all have population size comparable to or smaller than scotland , and all function well as independent state .
the nordic country have some of the strongest economy in the world , as do switzerland .
and the irish economy be , until recently , boom .
iceland be a very interesting example .
no major heavy industry , a population a little · over 1 @/@ 3 of a million , universal healthcare and education ( free at university level at state university ) and yet it manage to maintain one of the highest standard of live ( arguably the highest ) in the world .
claim that scotland would go bankrupt in no time be ridiculous .
it be entirely possible that scotland could follow the nordic example if it ever decide to vote for independence .
people forget that edinburgh be a reasonably large financial centre ( relatively large for a country of 5 million ) and that central scotland be a cradle for the industrial revolution .
add to that revenue from hybrocarbon extraction in the north sea , fish export , and the ability to become reasonably self @-@ sufficient in renewable energy ( wind , tidal , hydroelectric -@ there 's potential for it on scotland 's rugged landscape ) and i see no reason why scotland would be unable to function as an independent nation .
apology for misunderstand your nationality .
i think the difference with scotland to those nordic economy be that scotland 's current expenditure be higher than it would be ovule were to split .
it be enormously dependent on the support of the whole of the uk .
it would have to scrap free university fee , it would n't have the nhs , thus uk infrastructure employ many scots .
if it be n't to go bankrupt it would certainly struggle for decade .
the eu example just be n't the same at all .
the eu be not a country that actively support each other economically ( other than bailouts ) as much as a country do , it be n't as socially connect , it employ an extremely small percentage of people , they be n't politically connect and have no national identity .
you 're an idiot .
load of " far right " party advocate high tax , why ?
because it 's based on jealousy .
poor white folk blame their own poverty on the rich .
hitler have an extensive welfare state , the bnp would punish the banker to the point of destroy what be quite possibly the only real money maker the uk have .
lol bank be the only real money maker the uk has...
well firstly that be n't true and secondly they pay a pathetically small amount of tax anyway so provide next to nothing to this country .
they pay a small percent by the overage sum be huge .
where else do the money the government spend come from ?
do you really think that the west would lose to a bunch of country that hate their own neighbour ?
india and pakistan hate each other and then there be china who hate both .
the middle east would just be destroy if it be a total war .
if anything , the ' arrogance ' would increase as a result .
there be no way in hell that nato would lose to those country .
pakistan be no match for india now .
and in the future pakistan will be a mere annoyance than a real threat .
china and india may have their difference , but they 'll never go to war with each other .
they both stand to lose too much in the process .
china be already wrap a fist around the west 's ball by buy up their debt and forcing the west to be economically dependent on them .
very smart those chinese .
india should eventually get in on the act , while wean themselves off western investment , then when the time be right , they should use economic warfare to plunge western economy into chaos , cripple their financial power , and ultimately their military power .
after a few month so the west will be very vulnerable .
we 've have to endure your cr*p for generation .
we 're a patient people .
we don ; t have to rely on military power alone , and we can wait until the time be right .
be you aware that the arabs and white be rival power until the white europeans overtake follow the renaissance ?
million of white christians be enslave by arabs .
spain , a white country be occupy by arabs for century .
arabs conquer the old eastern roman empire , they attempt to invade europe for century , finally be repel at the battle of le panto .
white people today and victim of massive level of anti white violence all across the western world .
america especially .
you be a racist .
oh , i feel so sorry for the poor white people , they 've have it sooooo bad .
who the hell be the black , who be enslave by white to complain ?
who the hell be the indians , who be enslave and rob blind by white to complain ?
they 've be sooo bad to the white over the year , have n't they ?
and it 's not like black and asians ever suffer discrimination at the hand of white , be it ?
poor white .
you have it so bad .
idiot .
from all the other tax business and people pay ?
barclays pay £113m in corporation tax in 2009 if you combine it with all the other bank it do n't even make £1 billion so you be say that in 2009 the only money the government make be £1 billion ?
this be what happen when you dont believe in equality or understand how country make money .
see people can learn to live with each other peacefully , not via segregation .
who be this ' we '?
okay , china have the debt buy up , but if they be to be destroy who would chase it up ?
india be no match for any western country , not even belgium .
are you go to send the slum kid to attack , or how about the frail women ?
the west have far more economic and military power than the east , to suggest otherwise show that you 're delusional .
1 ) of course not , they have n't make them yet .
so on what basis will you attack iran ?
that they may acquire nuclear weapon .
that be so ****ing silly .
if the uk be plan to abolish murder as a criminal charge in a few year time , could i go out and murder 100 people based on the intention , " well , it 's go to be abolish anyway ".
2 ) i beg to differ .
it have repeatedly refuse to declare several site and when they be catch out they say they be go to declare them anyway .
evidence ?
3 ) as i say before here you be , make a pipsqueak about it and you only have to have an open mind to know that america 's be hypocritical .
i know america and israel be be hypocritical .
yet no one be tell them that .
first of all to put it into context israel do n't threaten iran .
it 's be the warmongering on the mullah ' part after they decide they want israel destroy for some obscure reason because their ideology advocate it .
iran be not an arab country , the israel @-@ arab conflict have absolutely nothing to do with iran .
the mullah have no right fund proxy there because they be get involve in something that have nothing to do with them .
the mullah themselves see the arabs as more of an enemy than israel so this comparison be idiotic as there will never , ever be unity in the middle east amongst muslims and i hope there never be either .
( 1 ) yet for 30 year , they do n't do anything .
in fact , iran have never even wage war against iran which cannot be say for it 's neighboring country .
a very optimistic view .
china and russia do n't want the us to throw its weight around so they 're use their veto as a feeble show of strength .
by veto the criticism of assad 's action they want to show that they will not just follow america 's lead on this one .
( 1 ) feeble : america 's look feeble .
they can n't intervene and save their beloved " democracy in action " because of russia/china .
there use to be a time when americans would say "**** the world , we be do this ".
defend itself against what ?
hezbollah be create by iran and khomeini decide to send revolutionary guard there to train militant as a ' resistance ' group .
they do n't seem to be do much resist by constantly fire rocket into israel be they ?
that 's a whole different argument and frankly , this have nothing to do with it .
as i say before the mullah have no right to poke their nose into the arab @-@ israel conflict so whether hezbollah attack first or otherwise , it do n't justify their action .
the afghan security force be create by the us and the coalition .
yet when they attack the people who they be " help ", they be label terrorist .
on the same scale , america have no right to poke it 's nose at the arab @/@ israel conflict if iran have n't get the same right .
why be there different rule for one country and different rule for other country ?
well it 's obvious they 'll say that but it 's obvious they 're after a bomb .
it 's so they can throw their weight around without fear of reprisal from america or israel , not for use .
they should n't be allow nukes , period .
as for an invasion , definitely not .
why be israel allow nukes though .
okay iran should not have nuclear weapon but israel have no right to say it ,
its like a thief tell other people not to thieve because its illegal
the same way i see the us invade pakistan instead of afghanistan even though pakistan have nukes .
because pakistan largely follow american order .
the us assist them in develop nukes in the first place .
as i say before iran initiate it...
how ?
for example ?
the shah seem pretty content with stay out of it .
the shah 's absolutism be a knock @-@ on effect .
mossadegh be go forward with social @-@ democratic nationalism that have be popularised by nasser and arab leader , and this lead to the 1953 coup .
where do i say that ?
note it be a question .
why do you keep jump to conclusion .
how do me explain the reason for china and russia 's veto somehow make me an american lover .
bishy say that ' we 'd see more positive result from china and russia ' and i imply that the chinese and russians hold no sympathy for the syrian people rather they want to maintain their control and not have the us throw its weight around .
the way op be write make it a good guess you 'd be back us @-@ israel because you seem to be agree with the propose intervention by them , but fair enough if you 're not .
though based on what you 're criticising iran for , it should be quite a bit down on your priority list .
no .
i be just mention the iran bit...
why do the us and israel have favour faction justify iran to do the same .
it do n't justify it , but it put their action into context .
on the same logic , be hit by someone do n't justify hit them , but it make why you do ( if you do ) understandable .
update an email law from the past century
steven warshak , a cincinnati businessman who build an empire sell male sexual enhancement drug , be convict of wire fraud several year ago , based in large part on his email correspondence , which authority have extract via a subpoena under a 1986 law govern electronic privacy .
a federal appeal court in ohio later found , however , that the government have violate warshak’s constitutional right to privacy .
the court say investigator should have convince a judge that there be probable cause and obtain a search warrant , as though his message have be stash in a desk drawer .
although the court let the conviction stand , the case highlight the conflict legal rule that govern electronic privacy .
congress be now set to clarify those rule , bring that quarter @-@ century @-@ old law , the electronic communication privacy act , or ecpa , in line with the internet age .
on thursday , the senate judiciary committee will start deliberate a measure that would require the government to get a search warrant , issue by a judge , to gain access to personal emails and all other electronic content held by a third @-@ party service provider .
the current statute require a warrant for emails that be less than 6 month old , but it let the authority gain access to older communication – or bizarrely , emails that have already be open – with just a subpoena and no judicial review .
the law govern the privacy of practically everything entrust to the internet – family photo store with a web service , journal entry keep online , company document uploaded to the cloud , and the flurry of emails exchange every day .
the problem be that it be write when the cloud be just a cumulus in the sky .
silicon valley company as well as advocacy group from the political left and right have be lobby for change for many year , and reform legislation seem to be gain broad political support .
even the justice department appear to have approve one major change : require law enforcement to get a search warrant for all kind of electronic content , no matter how long it have be in electronic storage or what exactly electronic storage mean .
“ change the law have become more of an imperative because of the growth of cloud compute , because everyone include member of congress be store sensitive info with third @-@ party provider and they want it to be protect , ” say greg nojeim , senior counsel at the washington @-@ based center for democracy and technology , which be finance partly by silicon valley company and which be part of a coalition push for reform .
“ the technology be advance and people realize the law have to keep pace.”
update the bill could have a broader impact on civil case as well , clarify who can gain access to emails , photo and facebook post in corporate litigation and divorce court .
it could also lie out clearer rule for government agency like the internal revenue service to follow to gain access to private citizens’ emails .
the agency tell congress recently that it seek search warrant before read taxpayer emails , though its write policy say otherwise , accord to an information request file by the american civil liberty union .
court across the country , apparently baffle by how to apply the exist law , which apply to content hold in “ electronic storage , ” have rule in sometimes contradictory way over the privacy of electronic material in both civil and criminal case .
in one prominent case , lee jennings sue a relative of his wife who broke into his yahoo account and ferret out emails describe an extramarital affair that be later use as incriminate evidence in divorce proceeding .
jennings claim a violation of his privacy under the electronic privacy act , but the highest court in his home state of south carolina hold that his emails , which sat on yahoo’s server , be not hold in “ electronic storage ” and therefore be not cover by the statute .
a federal court in california year earlier have rule differently in another case , interpret “ electronic storage ” far more broadly .
jennings’ lawyer , neal k . katyal , a former act solicitor general in the obama administration , ask the supreme court to reconcile the dueling interpretation .

george jones in real life and real time
early in 1977 , a couple of year after he and tammy wynette have divorce , the country music star george jones play a show at the stardust inn in waldorf , md . , his first in the washington area in several year .
i be then a young pop music critic at the washington post , so it fall to me to write a profile of the notoriously hard @-@ drink singer .
what follow be an experience so intense , so remarkable for its raw emotional force , that i could not help but think of it friday , when it be announce that jones have die in a nashville , tenn . , hospital at the age of 81 .
that weekend i learn two important thing about jones : that there be very little distance between him and his song , and that the same quality that make him a great artist also make his life a torment .
in those day he be still unashamedly carry a torch for wynette , who have leave him because , as she put it in legal paper she file , he “ drink to such an extent that he become completely and absolutely unmanageable.”
on stage that weekend , he reworked song like “ she think i still care ” and “ picture me without you ” so that they include reference to her , make them almost embarrassingly personal , as if she be in the audience and he be sing only to her .
but it be on his tour bus between set that i see george jones more achingly and nakedly vulnerable than any performer i have ever encounter , before or since that night .
he be dress in a flashy leisure suit and wear a pair of glitter diamond ring on his left hand , include one with his initial , but as he talk about wynette and how much he still love her , he begin to weep .
i don’t think he be drunk .
he talk about how he be try to stay dry for tammy , who by that time have already re @-@ marry and divorce again .
within a year or two , he would develop a cocaine habit that would send his career off the rail , but there be no sign of that either .
this be just george jones in real life and real time .
it be hard today , in a time when irony have become a dominant cultural mode and artist be screen from reporter by phalanx of handler , to imagine so public a breakdown happen or a celebrity let his pain be so visible .
but jones wasn’t ashamed or embarrass by that display , and when he go back to the stage for a second set of what he describe to me as “ sad , sloppy tear @-@ jerkers , ” his sing be even more passionate and inspire , with his twangy , somewhat nasal voice crack in all the right place with what have to be genuine feel , not artifice .
over a career that last nearly 60 year , jones record more than 100 album , and over and over again , he didn’t just sing the song that be give to him .
in the best of his recording , as on that night , he also inhabit them , so that anyone listen to him could be sure : he really mean it , he have really live this song about heartbreak or hangover and know what it mean , poor soul .
as someone who grow up in chicago listen mostly to the blue , i have no special fondness for country music , whose only local outlet in those day be the radio station wjjd .
but see george jones live for the first time that cold night in southern maryland be a revelation , because in his own highly idiosyncratic way he show himself to be no less soulful a singer than howlin’ wolf on something like “ how many more year ” or otis redding on “ i’ve been love you too long.”
despite all the drink and drug binge that would dog his career , jones never lose that gift .
in 2009 , assign to write a profile of the canadian singer @-@ songwriter leonard cohen for this newspaper , i walk into cohen’s new york hotel suite to find him play one of jones’ late @-@ career gem , “ choice , ” on his ipod .
cohen express great admiration for jones and then recite one of the song’s most powerful verse :
i be tempt
by an early age i find
i like drinkin’
oh , and i never turn it down
there be love one
but i turn them all away
now i’m live and die
with the choice i make
@in part because of his consistent “ nip , ” as he call it , jones never enjoy the crossover success of his contemporary johnny cash and merle haggard , and so his pass will probably not have the broad cultural resonance that cash’s do .
but he be , hand down , a superior singer , a fact obvious to everyone in the country music field : as waylon jennings once sang , “ if we all could sound like we want to , we’d all sound like george jones.”
but even within the confine of “ pure country , ” whatever that term might mean today , jones do not stand still .
he begin his career very much in the mold of his idol hank williams , sing tune about honky @-@ tonks and carouse .
he never lose his affection for that genre , but over the year he also evolve into a master of ballad sing , especially on his duet with melba montgomery and wynette , both before and after they be marry .
and though a brief late ‘50 s flirtation with rockabilly didn’t pan out , jones also know how to rock .
it’s almost forget now , but he and elvis presley once be co @-@ headliners on a louisiana hayride tour , and generation of rock ' n’ roll band , include one i play in , have cover song like “ why baby why , ” “ white lightning ” and “ the race is on ” and find them to be guarantee crowd @-@ pleasers .
begin in the 1980 s , jones , with the help of his fourth wife , nancy sepulvedo , pull himself out of his tailspin .
but by then the country music mainstream have begin to move on to more polished style , and jones’ visceral approach fall out of fashion .
in recent year , jones have think of himself as a relic , and express bitterness at what he see as the disregard for what he represent .
all that may be true , but it can’t – and doesn’t – dim the magnificence of his achievement , any more than his personal weakness and demon do .

the fbi offer in both letter to perform dna test on the hair fragment .
manning’s lawyer argue that these letter constitute new evidence and thus that the hair , as well as other evidence collect at the scene include a rape kit and fingernail scrapings , should be submit for dna test before man be put to death .
in the response deny the request , the state attorney general , jim hood , call the new request a “ red herring , ” say that the letter do not “ represent new evidence , ” nor do they repudiate the testimony give by the fbi expert in 1994 .
manning’s lawyer be still lobby the governor for a stay of execution .

agnew say the group would register thousand of new voter in the come month and return to the capitol for legislative committee hearing in the fall .

they promise to stay until scott convene a special session on ''stand your ground’' and several other criminal justice issue .

a pink @-@ slip thank for a major decision
on baseball ) ;
when john gaherin , the chief labor negotiator for major league baseball , arrive for a meet with the chief of the player union and baseball’s arbitrator , he carry an envelope in the pocket of his suit jacket .
it be two day before christmas 1975 , not a time to be conduct serious business , but gaherin and marvin miller , the executive director of the union , know why peter seitz , the arbitrator , have summon them .
they know that the subject of the meet would be as serious a bit of business as baseball have ever experience , and gaherin go to the meet prepare .
seitz have informally telegraph his decision in a grievance case , and now he would formally hand his write opinion to the two men .
as soon as he do , gaherin hand seitz the envelope .
“ you’re fire , ” it say in effect .
such be the perilous life of impartial arbitrator in baseball and other professional sport .
either side - the league or the union - have the right to fire them .
like manager , they be hire to be fire .
“ he tell me he have expect as much , ” michael seitz , peter’s son , say in a recent telephone interview .
“ his feel be there be no other way to decide the case , because the baseball owner have be stupid in assume that when they didn’t have a player under contract , they still have a contractual hold on him.”
fredric r . horowitz , a 64 @-@ year @-@ old lawyer from santa monica , calif . , be the latest to take a turn .
he will arbitrate alex rodriguez’s appeal of his 211 @-@ game suspension .
while arbitrator pay for their decision , which anger either the owner or the player , they don’t always receive credit for the significance of their decision .
seitz , for example , be responsible for create free agency in baseball with his decision in the 1975 andy messersmith @-@ dave mcnally grievance , but i believe , as marvin miller use to complain , that some report in the news media , include in the new york time , mistakenly credit other case : curt flood’s 1970 lawsuit against baseball and catfish hunter’s 1974 grievance against charlie finley .
flood’s suit challenge the game’s reserve clause , the rule that bound a player to his team until he be trade , sell or release .
hunter’s grievance contend that finley , the oakland athletics’ owner , have breach his contract .
the hunter case be exactly what the union argue , a breach @-@ of @-@ contract case .
finley have not pay the premium on hunter’s annuity , as stipulate in his contract , richard moss , the union lawyer , say , and the pitcher should be a free agent as a result .
seitz , in his first year as baseball’s arbitrator , agree with moss’ argument and declare hunter a free agent .
a year later , when seitz rule in the messersmith @-@ mcnally grievance , he do not cite the hunter decision as a basis for this decision .
as a breach @-@ of @-@ contract case , it affect no player but hunter .
no other player could gain free agency based on seitz’s decision on hunter .
“ it didn’t change the mind of a single owner , ” miller say of the hunter decision in one of the many conversation we have on the subject .
" the owners’ position on free agency be the same after the hunter case as it be before.''
nor , miller add , do the flood case affect the owners’ think on the reserve clause and free agency .
the reserve clause have forever be the tie that bound player to their team , whether they like it or not .
flood do not like it , and when the st . louis cardinal trade him to philadelphia , he opted to sue the commissioner rather than go to the phillies , contend that he should have the right to play where he want .
the suit go all the way to the u.s. supreme court , where flood lose .
the owner always argue that elimination of the reserve clause would ruin baseball , miller say , and flood’s loss in the lawsuit embolden them to maintain their position .
as heroic as flood be in pursue his lawsuit , it fall well short of have an effect .
its failure be one of the reason the owner be so confident of winning the messersmith @-@ mcnally grievance in court when they appeal seitz’s decision , which say player could be free agent if they play the renewal year in their contract without sign a new contract .
what the owner fail to understand , in their inexperience in labor matter , be that judge rarely overrule an arbitrator’s decision , do so only if an arbitrator’s authority have be exceed .
the club and the commissioner have not do particularly well before arbitrator in instance where player have be suspend for conduct off the field .
that history continue last year when shyam das overturn ryan braun’s 50 @-@ game suspension .
das be fire after his braun rule .
baseball would have prefer settle all of the dope case stem from the investigation into biogenesis , an anti @-@ aging clinic that be believe to have distribute ban substance to baseball player .
the union also seem eager to settle .
but rodriguez have appeal his 211 @-@ game suspension .
given the volatility of the rodriguez case , it would not be surprising if horowitz’s first major case be his last .

new york - it be just a small room , one of hundred in city college’s north academic center , but over the year the guillermo morales @/@ assata shakur student and community center have take on a significance beyond its square footage .
to student organizer who use it as their meet space , it be a place for lesbian and gay activist , women’s right group , community organization and others to make common cause .
to outside critic it be a symbol of campus politics gone berserk , its unofficial name a glorification of city college alumni who have join revolutionary organization and gone on the lam .
but official at city college , part of the city university of new york , insist that charge history be not a factor when they decide that the room would be better use as an annex for the school’s career service office , two floor below .

with just a day to go before midterm exam , the library be reopen after a few hour .
but room 3 @/@ 201 be not , result at least for a brief while in the incongruous sight of close door emblazon with a bold , black fist , below a crisp white sign that read career and professional development .
( the door have be repaint , without the fist , as of monday afternoon.)
given the center’s history , it could not have come entirely as a surprise when its former occupant let their dissatisfaction be know .
they organize protest rally , distribute flier , post video and demand that city college be shut down .

and just in time for an outdoor demonstration on monday , someone set off a fire alarm , send hundred of people out onto the plaza .
“ i think that the cuny administration be really scare of a lot of the organize and community @-@ build come out of the build , ” say alyssia osorio , director of the morales @/@ shakur center .

deidra hill , vice president of communication at city college , call the administration’s takeover of the room a matter of space .
she say the career service office need a quiet area where student can “ meet with outside employer , with alumni , to seek advice on careers.”
city college say the unusually swift action be necessary .

in a letter to obama , dewhurst say the federal government should reimburse texas county for the cost of house the undocumented immigrant because the feds have fail to secure the u.s. mexico border as they should have .
''it’s time we ask for that money back , '' dewhurst say in an email to supporter this week , ask them to sign a petition support his position .
''it’s outrageous that county jail pay for house to more than 130,000 people that illegally enter our state .
''in my experience , i believe the immigration conversation begin and end with strict border security , as our county can no longer fund this massive financial burden.''
in his letter to obama , dewhurst write : ''the dollar expend in this fashion would be better spent enhance law enforcement effort to better protect our citizens.''
no word yet from washington on what they think of dewhurst’s demand , but don’t expect a check to be arrive anytime soon .
dewhurst , who have draw three gop challenger in his re @-@ election bid , have make a sharp turn to the right in his political rhetoric since lose a u.s. senate runoff to tea party star ted cruz in july 2012 .
two week ago , dewhurst publicly advocate obama’s impeachment at a tea party forum in fort worth -- a move that draw surprise since it come from texas’ no . 2 officeholder .
state and county official have complain for year that detain immigrant be cost local taxpayers , and federal official have decline to reimburse any cost because the jail suspect be be hold on local charge .
similarly , state official have also complain that state prison be hold thousand of undocumented immigrant who be convict of state crime .
at one point last year , well over 12,000 state convict have deportation detainers on them -- mean that as soon as they complete their sentence or be parole they be subject to be deport , official say .
most be mexican citizen , prison official say .
proposal to deport convict serve time for nonviolent crime before they be parole have fail to gain support from legislative leader , who fear if they be parole and return home they would simply slip back across the border into texas .
the savings from that plan be estimate to be at least $ 15 million , official say at the time .

or do you think it might be just a basic one ?
see as i have to be crb for the olympics and they do n't say anything

i believe it would come up on a crb enhance check but that you would have nothing to worry about as the case be overturn .
as an ex @-@ employer i have to have crb check do for all my staff and many have conviction , it be up to the discretion of the employer how serious the conviction be to them and their business - i can n't see from what you have say how this ' conviction ' would be hold against you .
long as you be n't acquited due to a technicality and it 's just you who 's claim to be mistake for someone else , then it 's all good .
it 'll show on enhance crb check .
not sure about basic crb check .
the crime that i be find guilty for , be benefit fraud so that 's why im a bit worry work in a jobcentre , but then it be someone who use these forum 's who set me up on my previous account , who manage to use all my identity and then i get convict but overturn by a high judge
no it will not .
locog and the oda use disclosure scotland for their check
this be a new movie that premiere the other day at sundance .
it star john cusack as a right winger whose wife have be kill in action over in iraq .
instead of tell his two daughter about the death of their mother , he instead put that off , and decide to take them on a road trip .
the movie have get incredible buzz and be buy by harvey weinstein and company the first day it premiere , for a report 4 million .
the review of this movie seem to be pretty chill .
one reviewer talk about how instead of make a movie about the horror of actual combat and the horror of war , this film do what few movie i can think of at least in the war film genre seem to ever do : it focus on war effect on family member .
one reviewer talk about how " the pain and terror in cusacks face ( while try to tell his daughter ) never leave ".
i think this film really be something special and cant wait to see it .
this could be one hell of a movie .
