[MISC French] far-left killer leaves jail 
" I didn't keep any of the money — $4 million . 
I gave it all away to activist groups around the world , so my motives are unusual , so that does mitigate in sentencing , " said [PER Emery] , who frequently ran in provincial and federal elections as the leader of the [ORG Marijuana Party] . 
But the man who once spent more than two months in a [MISC Canadian] prison for passing a joint to an undercover officer is now preparing for a much longer stay in a [LOC U.S.] prison . 
" You 've got to keep busy in jail . 
You 've got to be reading , in my case writing . 
I'll be learning [MISC Spanish] , [MISC French] . 
You 've got to have projects , " he said . 
*sigh* 
That 's what happens when you have [PER Stephen Harper] in Parliament . 
[ORG Stupid Conservative Government] . 
They need to throw these punks in jail ! 
It 's disgusting that instead of dealing with Mr. [PER Emery] like a responsible government should - we pass him off like a hot potato to the [LOC USA] for them to deal with , and to be prosecuted under their laws where he has no bargaining power and fewer rights . 
I hate seein the prince go to jail 
twas a stupid mistake though 
I can't believe it 's actually going to happen . 
I remember reading about this forever ago and thinking " ah he'll be fine " fuck man. . 
Fuck [LOC america] . 
No , [LOC America] is alright , but fuck the [MISC American] government . 
Fuck the [MISC Canadian] government too . 
Although you do make a good point that it 's only a hate crime if a white person picks on a black person . 
haha They're the ones who're gonna agree to extradite him , in the first place . 
It 's fookin rediculous that he will be sentenced to a few years in jail just for selling seeds . 
He should be praised , instead of martyred 
Fuck governments in general . 
Another innocent man falls victim to the Machine . 
When will the madness end ? 
It 's _a_fucking_shame_what 's _happening_to_him , _but_ he_is_a_little_out_there._Not_eaxctly_the_best_spo kesperson_for_marijuana 
Is your space bar broken ? 
YES 
Yes_it_is . 
If it 's the other way around it 's no big deal for some reason . 
yea he has always been a little nutty... . 
publicly speaking out about destroying the [ORG DEA] single handedly lol 
[LOC Emery] rocks . 
And he 's awesome . 
That 's a shame :/ 
[ORG IFC] signs deal to expand insurance to farmers in [LOC East Africa] 
[LOC NAIROBI] , Nov. 25 ( [ORG Xinhua] ) -- [ORG International Finance Corporation] ( [ORG IFC] ) has signed agreements with three partners to expand access to insurance to thousands of farmers and livestock herders in [LOC Kenya] and [LOC Rwanda] to help protect their crops , animals and livelihoods from weather-related risks and natural disasters . 
[ORG IFC] , through the [ORG Global Index Insurance Facility] ( [ORG GIIF] ) , will confer grants totaling roughly 4.1 million [PER U. S.] dollars to the [ORG Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture/UAP Insurance] weather index insurance initiative in [LOC Kenya] ; the [ORG International Livestock Research Institute] ( [ORG ILRI] ) Livestock index insurance project in northern [LOC Kenya] ; and the [MISC MicroEnsure] weather index insurance project in [LOC Rwanda] . 
" These partnerships highlight [ORG IFC] 's commitment to expanding insurance and other financial products where they are needed most in [LOC Africa] . 
The [ORG Global Index Insurance Facility] will facilitate farmers' access to credit , leading to increased productivity , improved livelihoods and greater food security , " [PER Jean Philippe Prosper] , [ORG IFC] Director for [LOC Eastern] and [LOC Southern Africa] said . 
If she was my daughter , those 2 punks that raped her would be found one day after football practice in a ditch with a bullet in their heads . 
" We are grateful to the donors that have generously provided funding and to our partners for supporting this program . " 
The grants , the first three provided under the [MISC GIIF] program , will help bring weather-related , index-based insurance to about 35 , 000 farmers and 5,000 livestock herders in [LOC East Africa] over the next three years . 
" The implementation of these three first GIIF projects in [LOC Kenya] and [LOC Rwanda] will support the development of new insurance products and will increase expertise in this field , which will benefit smallholders and livestock keepers affected by climatic events , " he said . 
" In addition to the [LOC GIIF] , the [ORG European Union] is providing further financing to the [ORG ILRI Livestock Insurance] project in [LOC Kenya] through the 10th [ORG European Development Fund] , [ORG Kenya Rural Development Project] that will start in 2011 . " 
[ORG IFC] will confer a grant of up to 2.4 million dollars on [ORG Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture] , which expects to help insure 20,000 farmers in [LOC Kenya] over the next three years 
[ORG IFC] will confer a grant of up to 154,000 dollars on the [ORG ILRI] , which expects to help insure 5,000 livestock herders in northern [LOC Kenya] over the next two years . 
[ORG IFC] will confer a grant of up to 1.6 million dollars on MicroEnsure , which expects to insure 15,000 farmers in [LOC Rwanda] over the next three years . 
[ORG IFC] 's [ORG GIIF] program was established in 2009 to assist the development of index-based insurance for natural disasters and weather risks in developing countries , where insurance is rarely available . 
The grants will fund advisory activities , including local capacity building , infrastructure development , product development , and development of local insurance companies' capacity to provide index-based insurance products . 
Index-based insurance insures against catastrophic events , such as wind storms or droughts , depending on their severity . 
[LOC Amen] ! ! ! ! 
Index-linked insurance products eliminate the need for insurance companies to individually verify claims , reducing transaction costs and making it easier for the products and services to be offered to rural communities and in frontier regions . 
[ORG The European Union] committed 24.5 million euros as the first donor to the [ORG GIIF Trust Fund] . 
The fund is also supported by [LOC Japan] 's [ORG Ministry of Finance] with an initial grant of 2 million dollars , and the [ORG Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs] , which provided funding to establish the facility . 
Because post racial [LOC America] is showing itself.. . 
the same people who don't not like [LOC Obama] because of his race post this kind of crap . 
You are an idiot . 
I don't like obama because he is a socialist pig . 
If the perps are black they are still guilty . 
[MISC Chinese] President [PER Hu Jintao] has called on the entire nation to do more to ensure the safety of children , state press said Tuesday , in comments that follow a spate of grisly school killings . 
I am tired of thugs crying that they get in trouble just because they are black and that society made them do it , bull ! ! ! ! 
They are thugs and deserve a bullet . 
They should have been expelled from school at a minimum . 
I guess you know the whole story and can make that objective assessment ? 
You need to learn the definition of socialist , then readjust your priorities . 
Nevertheless , the whole stereotype you described is complete bullshit . 
Nope . 
Wasn't there . 
My opinion is based on the information provided . 
Welcome to a message board . 
" The entire society must pay importance to the safety of children and do everything to safeguard our motherland 's next generation , " the [ORG People 's Daily] quoted [PER Hu] as saying . 
Funny you should say that . 
A cousin of mine was raped a long time ago , the guy that did it commit suicide shortly after - blew his own head off with a shotgun . 
BIG QUESTION ! 
Why the hell do guys rape women anyway ? 
Women are horny as hell ! 
All you have to do is be nice to them and they'll pretty much accomodate you in any way you want . 
Yes , sometimes you have to give them time to think about it... . 
Besides which sex with women that are voluntarily engaged is an awful lot better . 
[PER Young] guys need a talkin' to.. . 
A talking to ? 
[PER Hu] was speaking Monday as he toured a [LOC Beijing] exhibit on transport and building safety with a group of schoolchildren on the eve of [MISC International Children 's Day] , the report said . 
How about jail ? 
16 year old girls do not consent to gang rape . 
No matter how " horny " or drunk they are . 
Please tell me you're not speaking from experience . 
You have to understand that in [LOC Texas] , Football is King and good football players are gods who can do no wrong . 
Worse than this has been swept under the rug for HS and college football stars there . 
No , I don't have to understand . 
Why is the title of your thread so insidious ? 
Why not a title lie " School Officials Screw over Rape Victim ? " 
That one would be more accurate . 
His remarks come after a spate of bloody school attacks around [LOC China] since late March which have left 17 people dead , including 15 students , and scores injured . 
Because this is not Your Thread to name . 
Works for me . 
And that question Wasn't Directed At You . 
Still doesn't bend reality now does it ? 
Not only did 4 Blacks rape this girl , the main perp only received [MISC ANGER MANAGEMENT] class with no jail time ! 
The girl was just 16 , a cheerleader at [ORG Silsbee High School] in [LOC Texas] . 
She was at a party in 2008 when football star [PER Rakheem Bolton] , fellow player [PER Christian Roundtree] and another boy pushed her into a bedroom and locked the door , held her down , and sexually assaulted her.. . 
When others tried to enter the room , [ORG Bolton] and [PER Roundtree] jumped out a window , leaving their clothes behind . 
The girl filed charges , but that didn't put an end to her trauma . 
Sphincteric school superintendent [PER Richard Bain Jr.] would make sure it only got worse . 
Experts say the senseless assaults reveal a [LOC China] struggling to come to grips with rapid social change following decades of booming economic growth . 
When the girl returned to school , administrators decided the best course of action was for the girl to slink away in a corner and try not to be seen . 
They told her to avoid the cafeteria and not take part in homecoming . 
Out of sight , out of mind . 
The kids were all teenagers , and the sex was claimed to be consensual . 
I have no idea whether it was , and neither does anyone of this forum . 
That remains to be seen . 
So yes , the title of this thread does kind of bend reality . 
Labour are a left wing socialist party . 
They are pro immigration if it supports the economy and believe in equal rights for all individuals . 
They are traditionally more likely and are known for allowing immigrants into the country - hence they were his target . 
On Sunday , a 47-year-old unemployed man was executed for carrying out an assault on 32 people , mostly small children , at a kindergarten in eastern [LOC China] in April . 
The labour party was responsible for the current state of immigration in the country , and in his own ideology , he wanted to take our future labour politicians ( which those in the camp were potentially ) from getting into power and allowing more in . 
In his mind , by taking them out , he can prevent future immigration . 
can't believe it , [LOC norway] is such a friendly quiet country , this guy must be nuts they dont even have that many migrants , at least not compared to [LOC UK] ! 
He basically hates [PER Islam] and believes that [MISC Islamic] immigration is a huge threat to [LOC Europe] . 
He thinks that [MISC European] politicians are allowing the colonisation of [LOC Europe] by [MISC Muslims] and so are all legitimate targets . 
He thinks we need to deport all [MISC Muslims] from [LOC Europe] [LOC Turkey North] [LOC Iran] and [LOC Palestine] . 
He attacked his own kind because killing [MISC Muslims] would lead to them being replaced by more [MISC Muslims] . 
So instead he decided to take out " the next generation of Left wing seeds " . 
In short he has wiped out a number of potential future left wing politicians . 
He also sees himself a bit like a templar knight defending [LOC Christianity] from [LOC Islam] 
The man , [PER Xu Yuyuan] , wielded a knife usually used to slaughter pigs . 
This . 
He isn't a [MISC White Supremacist] though . 
This is a bit of a myth . [LOC Oslo] is a hugely multicultural and as far as I 'm aware , [LOC Norway] as a whole is about on par with the [LOC UK] in terms of different ethnic groups . 
It 's a myth [MISC British] people seem to have that the [LOC UK] is one of the most multicultural places in [LOC Europe] , when in reality [LOC Sweden] , the [LOC Netherlands] and possibly [LOC Norway] are notably more so . 
I 'm not a fan of [PER David Cameron] . 
Thanks to his government , I'll likely be paying 3x as much as I would for university . 
I voted [ORG Labour] yesterday , I am a [ORG Labour] party member , with [MISC Scottish] roots . 
However , [PER David Cameron] *does* have a say , as do I , as do all of us , on whether we want the [LOC Union] to remain . 
[PER David Cameron] is the Prime Minister of the [LOC United Kingdom] . 
He has every right , and indeed , it should be his job to defend and persuade the [MISC Scottish] electorate and population that the [LOC United Kingdom] should remain , that [LOC Scotland] should vote no to any such referendum . 
[PER Xu] , who was sentenced to death on May 15 , told the court his motive was to vent his rage against society after losing money gambling and in business dealings , and suffering setbacks in his personal life . 
I would vote no . 
The world is changing , with a strengthening east and a weakening west . 
If the [LOC UK] were to split , we would all become weakened . 
I agree , [MISC Scottish] independence is a matter for the [MISC Scots] , and should they vote for it , then that vote should be respected . 
But , personally , I believe rather than a breakup , the union should be reformed , so there is equality for all the nations . 
Bit of an off point - but I'll just say the 'West [MISC Lothian'] question and leave you with that . 
You argue that [PER David Cameron] should not be able to 'poke his big nose in' to the idea of [MISC Scottish] independence - yet , [MISC Scottish] MPs are able to do just that when certain [MISC English] affairs are debated in [LOC Westminster] ( something [MISC English] MPs are not able to do with [MISC Scottish] affairs ) . 
This is why there should be an appetite for reform within the Union - not a messy divorce that will leave us weakened , not strengthened . 
I don't agree that [MISC Scottish] should have a voice in [LOC Westminster] concerning England-only matters . 
Indeed , it would be far more pragmatic if we devolved the entire union -a parliament for every 5 or 10 million people in [LOC England] perhaps ? 
In late April , a former doctor who stabbed eight schoolchildren to death in a March school attack was executed . 
( [LOC North/Midlands/London/South] east/west ? ) 
I 'm sure there wouldn't be as much appetite for independence north of the border if the [MISC Scots] felt that they weren't subordinate to a parliament situated hundreds of miles away that doesn't really represent them ( [LOC Holyrood] is overwhelmingly full of centre-left MSPs , yet we effectively have a centre right majority government in [LOC Westminster] ) . 
I 'm not necessarily for or against independence . 
I haven't really read into it enough to decide . 
I fully support the decision to go independent though , if that is the outcome of the referendum , just as I would support the decision to remain in the union . 
I 'm not [MISC Polish] . 
That was my point . 
My grandfather settled in the [LOC Falkirk] area of [LOC Scotland] after the second world war ( having served alongside [MISC British] armed forces during the liberation of [LOC Europe] ) . 
I have [MISC Polish] ancestry , the same way [PER Cameron] has [MISC Scottish] ancestry . 
The idea that [PER Cameron] 's ancestry should entitle him to vote on matters concerning the [MISC Scottish] parliament is as ludicrous as my ancestry entitling me to vote in the [MISC Polish] Sejm . 
Two other school assailants have committed suicide . 
[LOC ENSISHEIM] , [LOC France] , April 14 , 2010 ( AFP ) - 
The argument that since [PER Cameron] is the prime minister of the [LOC UK] , he should have a voice is more legitimate , but it is not an argument I agree with . 
And if [LOC Brittany] wished to split , that is an issue for those living in [LOC Brittany] . 
If [PER Sarkozy] isn't from [LOC Brittany] , then his only job should be in ensuring that the split occurs legally . 
The argument that the whole of the [LOC UK] should vote on [LOC Scotland] 's independence is like saying the whole of the [ORG EU] should get to vote if the [LOC UK] ever holds an in/out Eu membership referendum . 
It 's completely absurd and there 's no justification for it . 
And what 's to say [LOC Scotland] will go bankrupt ? 
[LOC Iceland] , [LOC Norway] , [LOC Denmark] , [LOC Finland] , [LOC Austria] , [LOC Switzerland] , [LOC Lithuania] , [LOC Estonia] , [LOC Latvia] and [LOC Ireland] all have population sizes comparable to or smaller than [LOC Scotland] , and all function well as independent states . 
The [LOC Nordic countries] have some of the strongest economies in the world , as does [LOC Switzerland] . 
And the [MISC Irish] economy was , until recently , booming . 
[LOC Iceland] is a very interesting example . 
Premier [PER Wen Jiabao] said last month that long-standing social concerns including joblessness and a gaping rich-poor divide were partially to blame for the string of attacks . 
No major heavy industry , a population a little · over 1/3 of a million , universal healthcare and education ( free at university level at state universities ) and yet it manages to maintain one of the highest standards of living ( arguably the highest ) in the world . 
Claiming that [LOC Scotland] would go bankrupt in no time is ridiculous . 
It is entirely possible that [LOC Scotland] could follow the [MISC Nordic] example if it ever decides to vote for independence . 
People forget that [LOC Edinburgh] is a reasonably large financial centre ( relatively large for a country of 5 million ) and that central [LOC Scotland] was a cradle for the industrial revolution . 
Add to that revenue from hybrocarbon extractions in the north sea , fishing exports , and the ability to become reasonably self-sufficient in renewable energy ( wind , tidal , hydroelectric -there 's potential for it on [LOC Scotland] 's rugged landscape ) and I see no reason why [LOC Scotland] would be unable to function as an independent nation . 
Apologies for misunderstanding your nationality . 
I think the difference with [LOC Scotland] to those [MISC Nordic] economies is that [LOC Scotland] 's current expenditure is higher than it would be ovule were to split . 
It is enormously dependent on the support of the whole of the [LOC UK] . 
It would have to scrap free university fees , it wouldn't have the [ORG NHS] , thus [LOC UK] infrastructure employs many [MISC Scots] . 
If it wasn't to go bankrupt it would certainly struggle for decades . 
" We need to resolve the deep-seated causes that have resulted in these problems , " [PER Wen] said in an interview with [MISC Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television] . 
The [ORG EU] example just isn't the same at all . 
The [ORG EU] is not a country that actively supports each other economically ( other than bailouts ) as much as a country does , it isn't as socially connected , it employs an extremely small percentage of people , they aren't politically connected and have no national identity . 
[MISC You're] an idiot . 
Loads of " far right " parties advocate high taxes , why ? 
Because it 's based on jealousy . 
Poor white folks blame their own poverty on the rich . 
[PER Hitler] had an extensive welfare state , the [ORG BNP] would punish the bankers to the point of destroying what is quite possibly the only real money maker the [LOC UK] has . 
Lol banking is the only real money maker the [LOC UK] has.. . 
well firstly that isn't true and secondly they pay a pathetically small amount of taxes anyway so provide next to nothing to this country . 
They pay a small percent by the overage sum is huge . 
" This includes handling social contradictions , resolving disputes and strengthening mediation at the grassroots level . " 
Where else does the money the government spend come from ? 
Do you really think that the [LOC West] would lose to a bunch of countries that hate their own neighbours ? 
[LOC India] and [LOC Pakistan] hate each other and then there is [LOC China] who hate both . 
The [LOC Middle East] would just be destroyed if it was a total war . 
If anything , the 'arrogance' would increase as a result . 
There is no way in hell that [ORG NATO] would lose to those countries . 
[LOC Pakistan] is no match for [LOC India] now . 
And in the future [LOC Pakistan] will be a mere annoyance than a real threat . 
[LOC China] and [LOC India] may have their differences , but they'll never go to war with each other . 
They both stand to lose too much in the process . 
Gadhafi attacks [LOC US] in speech in [LOC Italy] 
[LOC China] is already wrapping a fist around the [LOC West] 's balls by buying up their debt and forcing the west to be economically dependent on them . 
Very smart those [MISC Chinese] . 
[LOC India] should eventually get in on the act , while weaning themselves off western investment , then when the time is right , they should use economic warfare to plunge western economies into chaos , crippling their financial power , and ultimately their military power . 
After a few months so the [LOC West] will be very vulnerable . 
We 've had to endure your cr*p for generations . 
We're a patient people . 
We don ; t have to rely on military power alone , and we can wait until the time is right . 
are you aware that the arabs and whites were rival powers until the white europeans overtook following the renaissance ? 
millions of white christians were enslaved by arabs . 
[LOC spain] , a white country was occupied by arabs for centuries . 
[LOC ROME] 2009-06-11 13:34:38 [ORG UTC] 
arabs conquered the old eastern roman empire , they attempted to invade [LOC europe] for centuries , finally being repelled at the battle of le panto . 
white people today and victims of massive levels of anti white violence all across the western world . 
[LOC america] especially . 
you are a racist . 
Oh , I feel so sorry for the poor white people , they 've had it sooooo bad . 
Who the hell are the blacks , who were enslaved by whites to complain ? 
Who the hell are the [MISC Indians] , who were enslaved and robbed blind by whites to complain ? 
They 've been sooo bad to the whites over the years , haven't they ? 
And it 's not like Blacks and [MISC Asians] ever suffer discrimination at the hands of whites , is it ? 
Poor whites . 
[MISC Libyan] leader [PER Moammar Gadhafi] on Thursday urged the world to understand what motivates terrorists , and likened the 1986 [LOC U.S.] strikes on [LOC Libya] to [PER Osama bin Laden] 's terror attacks . 
You have it so bad . 
Idiot . 
from all the other taxes businesses and people pay ? 
[ORG Barclays] paid £113m in corporation tax in 2009 if you combine it with all the other banks it doesn't even make £1billion so you are saying that in 2009 the only money the government made was £1billion ? 
This is what happens when you dont believe in equality or understand how countries make money . 
See people can learn to live with each other peacefully , not via segregation . 
Who is this 'we' ? 
[LOC Okay] , [LOC China] has the debt bought up , but if they were to be destroyed who would chase it up ? 
[LOC India] are no match for any [MISC Western] country , not even [LOC Belgium] . 
Are you going to send the slum kids to attack , or how about the frail women ? 
[PER Gadhafi] , who was long accused of sponsoring terrorism , got tepid applause from the [MISC Italian] lawmakers he addressed on the second day of a trip to [LOC Italy] , [LOC Libya] 's former colonial ruler . 
The [LOC West] has far more economic and military power than the [MISC East] , to suggest otherwise shows that you're delusional . 
1 ) Of course not , they haven't made them yet . 
So on what basis will you attack [LOC Iran] ? 
That they MAY acquire nuclear weapons . 
That is so ****ing silly . 
If the [LOC UK] were planning to abolish murder as a criminal charge in a few years time , could I go out and murder 100 people based on the intention , " Well , it 's going to be abolished anyway " . 
2 ) I beg to differ . 
It has repeatedly refused to declare several sites and when they were caught out they said they were going to declare them anyway . 
Evidence ? 
3 ) As I said before here you are , making a pipsqueak about it and you only have to have an open mind to know that [LOC America] 's being hypocritical . 
" It is not very intelligent to chase terrorists down the [MISC Afghan] mountains or central [LOC Asia] , " [PER Gadhafi] said in the hour-long speech . 
I Know [LOC America] AND [LOC ISRAEL] are being hypocritical . 
Yet no one is telling them that . 
First of all to put it into context [LOC Israel] didn't threaten [LOC Iran] . 
It 's been the warmongering on the mullahs' part after they decided they wanted [LOC Israel] destroyed for some obscure reason because their ideology advocated it . 
[LOC Iran] is not an [MISC Arab] country , the [MISC Israel-Arab] conflict has absolutely nothing to do with [LOC Iran] . 
The mullahs have no right funding proxies there because they are getting involved in something that has nothing to do with them . 
The mullahs themselves see the [MISC Arabs] as more of an enemy than [LOC Israel] so this comparison is idiotic as there will never , ever be unity in the [LOC Middle East] amongst Muslims and I hope there never is either . 
( 1 ) Yet for 30 years , they didn't do anything . 
In fact , [LOC Iran] has never even waged war against [LOC Iran] which cannot be said for it 's neighboring countries . 
A very optimistic view . 
" That 's impossible . 
[LOC China] and [LOC Russia] don't want the [LOC US] to throw its weight around so they're using their veto as a feeble show of strength . 
By vetoing the criticism of [PER Assad] 's actions they want to show that they will not just follow [LOC America] 's lead on this one . 
( 1 ) [LOC Feeble:] [LOC America] 's looking feeble . 
They can't intervene and save their beloved " democracies in action " because of [ORG Russia/China] . 
There used to be a time when [MISC Americans] would say " **** the world , we are doing this " . 
Defending itself against what ? 
[ORG Hezbollah] was created by [LOC Iran] and [PER Khomeini] decided to send Revolutionary Guards there to train militants as a 'resistance' group . 
They don't seem to be doing much resisting by constantly firing rockets into [LOC Israel] are they ? 
That 's a whole different argument and frankly , this has nothing to do with it . 
As I said before the mullahs have no right to poke their nose into the [MISC Arab-Israel] conflict so whether [ORG Hezbollah] attacked first or otherwise , it doesn't justify their actions . 
We must look at their reasons . " 
A former militant of the [MISC French] far-left group [ORG Action Directe] , [PER Georges Cipriani] , left prison on parole on Wednesday after 23 years behind bars for two high-profile murders . 
The [MISC Afghan] security force was created by the [LOC US] and the coalition . 
Yet when they attack the people who they are " helping " , they are labelled terrorists . 
On the same scale , [LOC America] has no RIGHT to poke it 's nose at the [MISC Arab/Israel] conflict if [LOC Iran] hasn't got the same right . 
Why are there different rules for one country and different rules for other countries ? 
Well it 's obvious they'll say that but it 's obvious they're after a bomb . 
It 's so they can throw their weight around without fear of reprisal from [LOC America] or [LOC Israel] , not for use . 
They shouldn't be allowed nukes , period . 
As for an invasion , definitely not . 
why is [LOC israel] allowed nukes though . 
Okay [LOC Iran] should not have Nuclear weapons but [LOC Israel] has no right to say it , 
He called for dialogue with terrorists , saying , " One must talk to the devil , if it brings about a solution . " 
Its like a thief telling other people not to thieve because its illegal 
The same way I saw the [LOC US] invading [LOC Pakistan] instead of [LOC Afghanistan] even though [LOC Pakistan] have nukes . 
Because [LOC Pakistan] largely follows [MISC American] orders . 
The [LOC US] assisted them in developing nukes in the first place . 
As I said before [LOC Iran] initiated it.. . 
How ? 
For example ? 
The Shah seemed pretty content with staying out of it . 
The Shah 's absolutism was a knock-on effect . 
[PER Mossadegh] was going forward with social-democratic nationalism that had been popularised by [PER Nasser] and [MISC Arab] leaders , and this led to the 1953 coup . 
Sarcastically , he asked , " What 's the difference between the [LOC U.S.] airstrikes on our homes and bin [MISC Laden] 's actions ? " 
Where did I say that ? 
Note it was a question . 
Why do you keep jumping to conclusions . 
How did me explaining the reason for [LOC China] and [LOC Russia] 's veto somehow make me an [MISC American] lover . 
Bishy said that 'we 'd see more positive results from [LOC China] and [MISC Russia'] and I implied that the [MISC Chinese] and [MISC Russians] hold no sympathy for the [MISC Syrian] people rather they want to maintain their control and not have the [LOC US] throw its weight around . 
The way OP is written makes it a good guess you 'd be backing [MISC US-Israel] because you seemed to be agreeing with the proposed intervention by them , but fair enough if you're not . 
Though based on what you're criticising [LOC Iran] for , it should be quite a bit down on your priority list . 
No . 
I was just mentioning the [LOC Iran] bit.. . 
Why does the [LOC US] and [LOC Israel] having favoured factions justify [LOC Iran] to do the same . 
If anything , he said , bin [MISC Laden] is an outlaw , while the [LOC United States] is a country that should abide by international law . 
It doesn't justify it , but it puts their actions into context . 
On the same logic , being hit by someone doesn't justify hitting them , but it makes why you do ( if you do ) understandable . 
UPDATING AN EMAIL LAW FROM THE PAST CENTURY 
[PER Steven Warshak] , a [LOC Cincinnati] businessman who built an empire selling male sexual enhancement drugs , was convicted of wire fraud several years ago , based in large part on his email correspondence , which authorities had extracted via a subpoena under a 1986 law governing electronic privacy . 
A federal appeals court in [LOC Ohio] later found , however , that the government had violated Warshak’s constitutional right to privacy . 
The court said investigators should have convinced a judge that there was probable cause and obtained a search warrant , as though his messages had been stashed in a desk drawer . 
Although the court let the conviction stand , the case highlighted the conflicting legal rules that govern electronic privacy . 
[ORG Congress] is now set to clarify those rules , bringing that quarter-century-old law , the [ORG Electronic Communications Privacy Act] , or [ORG ECPA] , in line with the [MISC Internet] age . 
On Thursday , the [ORG Senate Judiciary Committee] will start deliberating a measure that would require the government to get a search warrant , issued by a judge , to gain access to personal emails and all other electronic content held by a third-party service provider . 
The current statute requires a warrant for emails that are less than 6 months old , but it lets the authorities gain access to older communications – or bizarrely , emails that have already been opened – with just a subpoena and no judicial review . 
Former President [PER Ronald Reagan] ordered airstrikes on [LOC Tripoli] and [LOC Benghazi] in April 1986 after an attack on a disco in [LOC Germany] killed three people , including two [LOC U.S.] servicemen . 
The law governs the privacy of practically everything entrusted to the [MISC Internet] – family photos stored with a Web service , journal entries kept online , company documents uploaded to the cloud , and the flurry of emails exchanged every day . 
The problem is that it was written when the cloud was just a cumulus in the sky . 
[LOC Silicon Valley] companies as well as advocacy groups from the political left and right have been lobbying for change for many years , and reform legislation seems to be gaining broad political support . 
Even the [ORG Justice Department] appears to have approved one major change: requiring law enforcement to get a search warrant for all kinds of electronic content , no matter how long it has been in electronic storage or what exactly electronic storage means . 
“Changing the law has become more of an imperative because of the growth of cloud computing , because everyone including members of [ORG Congress] are storing sensitive info with third-party providers and they want it to be protected , ” said [PER Greg Nojeim] , senior counsel at the [MISC Washington-based] [ORG Center for Democracy and Technology] , which is financed partly by [LOC Silicon Valley] companies and which is part of a coalition pushing for reform . 
“The technology is advancing and people realize the law has to keep pace.” 
Updating the bill could have a broader impact on civil cases as well , clarifying who can gain access to emails , photos and [ORG Facebook] posts in corporate litigation and divorce court . 
It could also lay out clearer rules for government agencies like the [ORG Internal Revenue Service] to follow to gain access to private citizens’ emails . 
The agency told [ORG Congress] recently that it seeks search warrants before reading taxpayer emails , though its written policy says otherwise , according to an information request filed by the [ORG American Civil Liberties Union] . 
Courts across the country , apparently baffled by how to apply the existing law , which applies to content held in “electronic storage , ” have ruled in sometimes contradictory ways over the privacy of electronic material in both civil and criminal cases . 
The [MISC Libyans] say the retaliatory attacks killed 41 people , including [PER Gadhafi] 's adopted daughter , and injured 226 others . 
In one prominent case , [PER Lee Jennings] sued a relative of his wife who broke into his [ORG Yahoo] account and ferreted out emails describing an extramarital affair that were later used as incriminating evidence in divorce proceedings . 
[PER Jennings] claimed a violation of his privacy under the electronic privacy act , but the highest court in his home state of [LOC South Carolina] held that his emails , which sat on Yahoo’s servers , were not held in “electronic storage” and therefore were not covered by the statute . 
A federal court in [LOC California] years earlier had ruled differently in another case , interpreting “electronic storage” far more broadly . 
Jennings’ lawyer , [PER Neal K. Katyal] , a former acting solicitor general in the [LOC Obama] administration , asked the [ORG Supreme Court] to reconcile the dueling interpretations . 
The court declined to hear the case this month , effectively leaving it to [ORG Congress] to clarify the law . 
Although the appeals court ruling in the [LOC Warshak] criminal case is binding only in the 6th Circuit , it has since become the default legal threshold for many Web companies . 
[ORG Facebook] says it turns over content created by users – pictures , posts , messages – only after it is served with a search warrant , though a subpoena suffices for basic subscriber information , including a user’s name and email address . 
Twitter , too , says “requests for contents of communication require a [LOC U.S.] search warrant , ” and it informs users when it receives a request for information from a government agency . 
[ORG Microsoft] , which operates email and cloud storage services , follows a similar practice , insisting on a search warrant for “content , ” including documents , photos , email and instant messages . 
With a subpoena , the company can divulge a user’s [ORG Internet Protocol] record , though , which can be used to establish a person’s location . 
The [MISC Libyan] leader told the lawmakers he was being intentionally provocative " in order to try and understand acts of terrorism . " 
“The law is so old it doesn’t account for how we have turned into a digital society , ” said [PER Bryan Schilling] , a lawyer at [ORG Microsoft] . 
He offered an offline analogy: “If somebody had a storage unit , law enforcement would be required to get a search warrant , ” he said . 
“It’s the same thing now , as we store more and more of our content in the cloud , consumer or enterprise.” 
The original sponsor of the 1986 law , Sen. [PER Patrick Leahy] , [ORG D-Vt.] , has called its overhaul his top priority for the year . 
He and Sen. [PER Mike Lee] , [PER R-Utah] , have introduced a measure requiring law enforcement to obtain a warrant for all electronic content , including emails , regardless of how old they are . 
That overhaul is backed by an unlikely coalition . 
Amazon and [ORG Google] , which offer cloud-based services to consumers and businesses , are lobbying for the change , along with startups like [ORG Evernote] and [ORG Tumblr] , which operate modern-day private diaries . 
They have joined with advocacy groups as diverse as the [ORG American Civil Liberties Union] and [ORG Americans for Tax Reform] . 
The issue of email privacy received the greatest attention last year , when Gen. [PER David H. Petraeus] , the former director of the [ORG Central Intelligence Agency] , resigned after an inquiry into his email correspondence turned up evidence of an extramarital affair . 
He and his biographer , [PER Paula Broadwell] , had exchanged amorous correspondence in a “draft” folder of a shared [MISC Gmail] account , apparently to elude detection . 
[PER Gadhafi] had long been ostracized by the [LOC West] for sponsoring terrorism , but in recent years sought to emerge from his pariah status by abandoning weapons of mass destruction and renouncing terrorism in 2003 . 
Those draft messages , because they had not been transmitted across the [MISC Internet] , could have been viewed by federal authorities with nothing more than a subpoena , according to current law . 
[PER GEORGE JONES] IN REAL LIFE AND REAL TIME 
Early in 1977 , a couple of years after he and [PER Tammy Wynette] had divorced , the country music star [PER George Jones] played a show at the [LOC Stardust Inn] in [LOC Waldorf] , [LOC Md.] , his first in the [LOC Washington] area in several years . 
I was then a young pop music critic at [ORG The Washington Post] , so it fell to me to write a profile of the notoriously hard-drinking singer . 
What followed was an experience so intense , so remarkable for its raw emotional force , that I could not help but think of it Friday , when it was announced that [PER Jones] had died in a [LOC Nashville] , [LOC Tenn.] , hospital at the age of 81 . 
That weekend I learned two important things about Jones: that there was very little distance between him and his songs , and that the same qualities that made him a great artist also made his life a torment . 
In those days he was still unashamedly carrying a torch for [PER Wynette] , who had left him because , as she put it in legal papers she filed , he “drinks to such an extent that he becomes completely and absolutely unmanageable.” 
On stage that weekend , he reworked songs like “She Thinks I Still Care” and “Picture Me Without [MISC You”] so that they included references to her , making them almost embarrassingly personal , as if she were in the audience and he was singing only to her . 
But it was on his tour bus between sets that I saw [PER George Jones] more achingly and nakedly vulnerable than any performer I have ever encountered , before or since that night . 
He was dressed in a flashy leisure suit and wore a pair of glittering diamond rings on his left hand , including one with his initials , but as he talked about [PER Wynette] and how much he still loved her , he began to weep . 
[LOC Libya] has since agreed to pay compensation to the families of the [LOC Berlin] disco victims as well as the families of the victims of the 1988 [ORG Pan Am] 103 bombing over [LOC Lockerbie] , [LOC Scotland] , which killed 270 people , including 189 [MISC Americans] . 
I don’t think he was drunk . 
He talked about how he was trying to stay dry for [PER Tammy] , who by that time had already re-married and divorced again . 
Within a year or two , he would develop a cocaine habit that would send his career off the rails , but there was no sign of that either . 
This was just [PER George Jones] in real life and real time . 
It is hard today , in a time when irony has become a dominant cultural mode and artists are screened from reporters by phalanxes of handlers , to imagine so public a breakdown happening or a celebrity letting his pain be so visible . 
But [LOC Jones] wasn’t ashamed or embarrassed by that display , and when he went back to the stage for a second set of what he described to me as “sad , sloppy tear-jerkers , ” his singing was even more passionate and inspired , with his twangy , somewhat nasal voice cracking in all the right places with what had to be genuine feeling , not artifice . 
Over a career that lasted nearly 60 years , [PER Jones] recorded more than 100 albums , and over and over again , he didn’t just sing the songs that were given to him . 
In the best of his recordings , as on that night , he also inhabited them , so that anyone listening to him could be sure: He really means it , he has really lived this song about heartbreak or hangovers and knows what it means , poor soul . 
As someone who grew up in [LOC Chicago] listening mostly to the blues , I had no special fondness for country music , whose only local outlet in those days was the radio station [ORG WJJD] . 
But seeing [PER George Jones] live for the first time that cold night in southern [LOC Maryland] was a revelation , because in his own highly idiosyncratic way he showed himself to be no less soulful a singer than [PER Howlin’ Wolf] on something like “How Many More Years” or [PER Otis Redding] on “I’ve [MISC Been Loving You Too] [MISC Long.”] 
[MISC Libyan] [PER Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi] was convicted of blowing up the plane . 
Despite all the drinking and drug binges that would dog his career , [PER Jones] never lost that gift . 
In 2009 , assigned to write a profile of the [MISC Canadian] singer-songwriter [PER Leonard Cohen] for this newspaper , I walked into [LOC Cohen’s] [LOC New York] hotel suite to find him playing one of [MISC Jones’] late-career gems , “Choices , ” on his iPod . 
[PER Cohen] expressed great admiration for [PER Jones] and then recited one of the song’s most powerful verses: 
I was tempted 
By an early age I found 
I liked drinkin’ 
Oh , and I never turned it down 
There were loved ones 
But I turned them all away 
Now I’m living and dying 
The [LOC United States] restored diplomatic ties with [LOC Libya] in 2006 and removed the [MISC North African] nation from the [ORG State Department] list of countries that sponsor terrorism . 
A policeman at the scene confirmed to [ORG AFP] the identity of [PER Cipriani] , 59 , who left the prison in [LOC Ensisheim] in northeastern [LOC France] wearing a leather jacket and with long white hair . 
With the choices I made 
@In part because of his consistent “nipping , ” as he called it , [PER Jones] never enjoyed the crossover success of his contemporaries [PER Johnny Cash] and [PER Merle Haggard] , and so his passing will probably not have the broad cultural resonance that Cash’s did . 
But he was , hands down , a superior singer , a fact obvious to everyone in the country music field: As [PER Waylon Jennings] once sang , “If we all could sound like we wanted to , we’d all sound like [PER George Jones.”] 
But even within the confines of “pure country , ” whatever that term might mean today , [PER Jones] did not stand still . 
He began his career very much in the mold of his idol [PER Hank Williams] , singing tunes about honky-tonks and carousing . 
He never lost his affection for that genre , but over the years he also evolved into a master of ballad singing , especially on his duets with [PER Melba Montgomery] and [PER Wynette] , both before and after they were married . 
And though a brief late ‘50s flirtation with rockabilly didn’t pan out , [PER Jones] also knew how to rock . 
It’s almost forgotten now , but he and [PER Elvis Presley] once were co-headliners on a [LOC Louisiana] [MISC Hayride] tour , and generations of rock 'n’ roll bands , including ones I played in , have covered songs like “Why Baby Why , ” “White Lightning” and “The Race Is On” and found them to be guaranteed crowd-pleasers . 
Beginning in the 1980s , [PER Jones] , with the help of his fourth wife , [PER Nancy Sepulvedo] , pulled himself out of his tailspin . 
But by then the country music mainstream had begun to move on to more polished styles , and [PER Jones’] visceral approach fell out of fashion . 
[PER Gadhafi] 's visit to [LOC Italy] continued that process of emergence from international isolation . 
In recent years , [PER Jones] had thought of himself as a relic , and expressed bitterness at what he saw as the disregard for what he represented . 
All that may be true , but it can’t – and doesn’t – dim the magnificence of his achievements , any more than his personal weaknesses and demons did . 
[ORG DEATH ROW] INMATE ’ S REQUEST FOR DNA TESTING IS REJECTED 
The state of [LOC Mississippi] rejected on Monday a request to submit physical evidence for DNA testing made by a prisoner scheduled to be put to death Tuesday evening . 
[PER Willie J. Manning] , convicted in 1994 of murdering two college students , had been repeatedly rebuffed in the courts as he sought to have DNA tests performed on certain crime scene evidence . 
But the most recent requests came about because of two letters sent by the [ORG Justice Department] in recent days to the prosecutor who handled [MISC Manning’s] trial . 
The letters concerned the trial testimony of an [ORG FBI] expert asked to examine “hair fragments” found at the scene of the murders . 
The expert testified that in this case he could determine only that the hairs came from an [MISC African-American] but that hair comparison analysis was capable , given better samples , of matching a hair to a particular individual . 
[PER Manning] is black ; the murder victims were white . 
The prosecutor cited this testimony several times in his closing arguments . 
But it also drew protests , including at [LOC La] [MISC Sapienza] university , where [PER Gadhafi] was addressing a group of few hundred students . 
In a letter dated May 2 , the [ORG Justice Department] said the expert’s testimony about the general capability of hair analysis – that it could match a hair to a specific individual – was erroneous and “exceeded the limits of the science.” 
Then , in a letter dated May 4 , the department further said that such analysis could not “determine” that a hair came from a person of a certain race , as the expert testified at one point , only that the hair “possesses certain traits that are associated with a particular racial group.” 
The [ORG FBI] offered in both letters to perform DNA testing on the hair fragments . 
Manning’s lawyers argued that these letters constituted new evidence and thus that the hairs , as well as other evidence collected at the scene including a rape kit and fingernail scrapings , should be submitted for [MISC DNA] testing before [PER Manning] is put to death . 
In the response denying the requests , the state attorney general , [PER Jim Hood] , called the new requests a “red herring , ” saying that the letters did not “represent new evidence , ” nor did they repudiate the testimony given by the [ORG FBI] expert in 1994 . 
Manning’s lawyers are still lobbying the governor for a stay of execution . 
On Friday , Manning’s brother and the [ORG Mississippi Innocence Project] filed suit to preserve all the physical evidence for DNA testing even if the execution is carried out . 
FOCUS TURNS TO THREE SUSPECTS IN [MISC BELGIAN] DIAMOND ROBBERY 
[LOC PARIS] – Investigators in three countries continued unraveling the plot behind a brazen $50 million diamond robbery in [LOC Belgium] , focusing Thursday on a [MISC Swiss] lawyer , a real estate businessman and a [MISC French] luxury car exporter with a prison record for fraud . 
After a series of raids Tuesday and Wednesday in [LOC Switzerland] , [LOC Belgium] and [LOC France] , the authorities started releasing some of the more than 30 men who were arrested and questioned in connection with the Feb. 18 robbery , in which armed men in police suits attacked a [MISC Zurich-bound] plane minutes before takeoff from the [LOC Brussels] airport . 
The speech to lawmakers was likely to raise more controversy . 
Investigators in [LOC Belgium] and [LOC Switzerland] suspect that a critical organizer in the plot was [PER Marc Bertoldi] , 43 , a [MISC French] car exporter whose listed address was in a wealthy seaside neighborhood of [LOC Antibes] on the [PER Cote] d’Azur and who owns a restaurant in [LOC Casablanca] , [LOC Morocco] . 
He was arrested Tuesday in [LOC France] and remains in prison , awaiting a hearing May 16 in [LOC Metz] for extradition to [LOC Belgium] . 
Investigators said Bertoldi’s arrival in [LOC Geneva] after the theft had provided a critical breakthrough in the inquiry . 
After Bertoldi’s arrest , the police trailed an unidentified [MISC Swiss] lawyer and a real estate owner Wednesday as they made an exchange of a key to a cellar where some of the stolen diamonds were discovered . 
Bertoldi’s lawyer , [PER Olivier Rondu] , said Thursday that his client denied the accusations against him and was willing to be extradited to [LOC Belgium] to confront the charges . 
“He has a surprising position that he wants to go to [LOC Belgium] as quickly as possible to explain himself , because he says he has done nothing , ” [PER Rondu] said . 
“He denies participating in the robbery at [LOC Brussels] airport.” 
[PER Rondu] also confirmed that his client had been convicted in the past for fraud and robbery and had served a prison term . 
In [LOC Switzerland] , where eight people were arrested Wednesday , the real estate owner and the [MISC Swiss] lawyer remained in detention . 
[PER Francois Canonica] , a lawyer for the [MISC Swiss] lawyer , also denied any wrongdoing on his client’s part , telling a [MISC Swiss] newspaper , [LOC Tribune de Geneve] , “My client has faith that ultimately he will be acquitted.” 
He had been set to speak inside the [ORG Italian Senate] , a rare honor for visiting dignitaries . 
MILITANT SAYS HE IS BEHIND FATAL [LOC NIGER] ATTACK 
[LOC DAKAR] , [LOC Senegal] - [PER Mokhtar Belmokhtar] , the mastermind of the January seizure of an [MISC Algerian] gas plant that left dozens of foreign hostages dead , has claimed responsibility for another terrorist attack - the suicide bombings on Thursday in [LOC Niger] that killed about 30 people , including 24 soldiers and at least six jihadists . 
If true , Belmokhtar’s claim would put one of the [MISC Sahel’s] most hardened militants , whom [MISC Chad’s] military said in March it had killed in battle , back at the center of the region’s fight against [MISC Islamist] jihad . 
Experts saw no reason to doubt Belmokhtar’s claim , despite the unconfirmed claim by the [MISC Chadian] military , which said that [ORG Belmokhtar] had died in the [LOC Ifoghas] mountain range during the joint [MISC French-Chadian] campaign against [MISC Islamist] militants in northern [LOC Mali] . 
Neither [LOC France] nor [LOC Algeria] , where [PER Belmokhtar] has been a wanted man for years for his role in the 1990s civil war there , ever confirmed Chad’s assertion . 
No proof was presented of his death , and a fellow militant later denied it in an [MISC Internet] posting . 
The latest claim by Belmokhtar - a veteran of training by al-Qaida in [LOC Afghanistan] , years of terrorist acts against the [MISC Algerians] and multiple kidnappings of [MISC Westerners] in the [LOC Sahara] - came hours after bomb-laden vehicles ripped through a military installation and a [MISC French-owned] uranium mine in [LOC Niger] . 
[PER Belmokhtar] , who is considered perhaps the most redoubtable of the region’s surviving militants , also played a leading role in the [MISC Islamist] takeover of northern [LOC Mali] last year . 
The new claim was made on a number of different websites . 
In one , [PER Belmokhtar] himself , using his nom de guerre [PER Khalid Abu al-Abbas] , signed a claim on jihadist forums that fighters from his “Those Who Sign with [MISC Blood”] brigade - the same group that carried out the [LOC Algeria] attack - blew up the [MISC French] mine and the [LOC Niger] base , according to the [ORG SITE Monitoring Service] , which tracks extremists . 
But opposition lawmakers balked , forcing the speech to be moved to a palazzo next door . 
The claim was posted by the same user who put out a video of [MISC Belmokhtar] in December , SITE said , and it asserted that the attacks were in retaliation for purported assertions by [LOC Niger] to have defeated the jihadists . 
“We warn all the countries that are intending to participate in the [MISC Crusader] campaign on our land , even if in the name of peacekeeping , that we will make you taste the heat of death and wounds in your homelands and among your soldiers , ” SITE quoted [PER Belmokhtar] as saying . 
[LOC BRITAIN] AND [LOC ECUADOR] MAY DISCUSS ASSANGE CASE 
[LOC LONDON] - The [MISC Ecuadorean] foreign minister is due to travel to [LOC London] this month and has offered to meet his [MISC British] counterpart to discuss the impasse over the [PER Julian Assange] case , officials from both countries said on Monday . 
Assange , the founder of the anti-secrecy group [ORG WikiLeaks] , has been holed up for nearly a year in the tiny [MISC Ecuadorean] Embassy here , stymying [MISC British] attempts to extradite him to [LOC Sweden] . 
The [MISC Swedish] authorities want to question Assange in connection with accusations that he sexually assaulted two women , but he has said he fears that the [MISC Swedes] will in turn send him to the [LOC United States] to answer questions about his role in helping disseminate classified government information via WikiLeaks . 
The development concerning [ORG Assange] came on the same day as the court-martial of [MISC Pfc.] [PER Bradley Manning] , the Army private accused of passing on sensitive diplomatic and military information , was scheduled to begin in [LOC Maryland] . 
[PER Manning] has pleaded guilty to 20 of the 22 charges against him , but he has not admitted to the most serious charge , aiding the enemy . 
[PER Manning] has said he gave the material to [PER WikiLeaks] , which then helped disseminate it . 
Assange has never acknowledged that [PER Manning] was his source . 
[PER Enrico Morando] , a senator of the opposition [ORG Democratic Party] , said [PER Gadhafi] 's presence at the [ORG Senate] would have been a " humiliation of this country 's democratic and republican spirit . " 
A spokesman for the [MISC Ecuadorean] government said last week that the foreign minister , [PER Ricardo Patino] , planned to travel to [LOC London] on June 16 , three days before Assange’s first anniversary in the embassy , and to meet with [PER Assange] . 
[ORG “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador] has informed [LOC U.K.] authorities that Mr. [PER Patino] will be in [LOC London] and has offered to meet with Foreign Secretary [PER William Hague] to discuss the case of [PER Julian Assange] , ” the spokesman said . 
A spokesman for the [MISC British] [ORG Foreign Office] said it was informed of [ORG Patino’s] trip on Friday and was “considering” his request for a meeting with [ORG Hague] . 
“U.K. government officials have been in regular contact with representatives of the [MISC Ecuadorean] government , both in [LOC London] and [LOC Quito] , about Mr. [PER Assange] , ” the [ORG Foreign Office] said in a statement . 
“We hope the visit will contribute to our joint commitment to finding a diplomatic solution to this issue.” 
Last week , [ORG Reuters] quoted [PER Patino] as saying his government was preparing a document in which it would argue that [LOC Britain] is legally obliged to give Assange permission to travel to [LOC South America] . 
SOUTH AFRICAN LEADER CITES 'PROGRESS' IN MANDELA'S CONDITION 
[LOC JOHANNESBURG] - After four days in the hospital battling a lung infection , former President [PER Nelson Mandela] of [LOC South Africa] “is responding better to treatment , ” President [PER Jacob Zuma] told [ORG Parliament] in [LOC Cape Town] on Wednesday . 
“We are very happy with the progress that he’s now making , following a difficult few days , ” [PER Zuma] said . 
It was the first report of an improvement in Mandela’s condition since he was admitted to a hospital in [LOC Pretoria] early Saturday after suffering a recurrence of a persistent lung ailment , a legacy of the tuberculosis he contracted during the 27 years he was imprisoned for opposing apartheid . 
" Only those who have the credentials _ in terms of democracy and protection of human rights _ are entitled to speak to Parliament , the inviolable temple of democracy , " he told [ORG La Repubblica] newspaper . 
His health has been frail lately , and this hospitalization was his fourth in the last seven months . 
Government officials in the last few days had been more downbeat , describing [MISC Mandela’s] condition as “serious but stable” with no improvement . 
[PER Mandela] , 94 , is being treated in an intensive care unit , where close family members have been visiting him regularly . 
Among them are his daughters , his former wife [PER Winnie Madikizela-Mandela] and his grandson [PER Mandla Mandela] . 
His current wife , [PER Graça Machel] , canceled a speech in [LOC London] to be by his side . 
[PER Mandla Mandela] , who is a traditional leader in the [LOC Eastern Cape] village where his grandfather was born , spoke to reporters outside [MISC Mandela’s] home . 
“My grandfather is the father of the nation , ” he said . 
“He’s embraced by the global community , and we appreciate the support that we’ve received.” 
As an underground leader of the banned [ORG African National Congress] , [PER Mandela] was convicted of treason 49 years ago Wednesday . 
He was sentenced to life in prison , but was released in 1990 as the government , under intense international pressure , began negotiating with [PER Mandela] and the [ORG ANC] . 
Human rights organizations and other critics have also denounced a recent deal that allows [LOC Italy] to send immigrants back to [LOC Libya] if they are intercepted at sea . 
[PER Mandela] was elected as [MISC South Africa’s] first black president in 1994 and served one term . 
He retired from public life in 2004 , and has not been seen in public since 2010 , when [LOC South Africa] hosted the [MISC World Cup] . 
MILITANTS ATTACK U.N . 
COMPOUND IN [LOC SOMALIA] 
[LOC MOGADISHU] , [LOC Somalia] - Militants staged a deadly assault on a [ORG U.N.] compound here Wednesday , the latest in a series of attacks that have chipped away at the security gains the [MISC Somali] capital has experienced in recent years . 
The [MISC Shabab] , the fearsome [MISC Islamist] militant group that once controlled much of the capital , claimed responsibility for the attack , which government officials said left at least 15 people dead , including seven attackers . 
The assault began when [MISC Shabab] militants blew up a pickup truck rigged with explosives outside the compound , witnesses said . 
Militants armed with rifles and wearing explosive vests then stormed the facility on foot . 
[MISC Somali] and [ORG African Union] troops responded to the scene . 
The ensuing firefight lasted more than an hour , punctuated by a series of blasts . 
They also decried [LOC Libya] 's treatment of the migrants and its poor human rights record . 
Somalia’s minister of interior and national security , [PER Abdikarim Hussein Guled] , told reporters that the dead included four foreigners , four [MISC Somalis] working for the [ORG United Nations] as security personnel , as well as the attackers . 
In a statement , [MISC Somalia’s] prime minister , [PER Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid] , condemned “the senseless and despicable attack on innocent [ORG U.N.] civilians.” 
[LOC Mogadishu] has experienced a period of relative calm since [ORG African Union] forces and the [MISC Somali] army pushed back the [MISC Shabab] , leading it to announce a hasty retreat from the city in 2011 . 
The militant group vowed to shift tactics more toward guerrilla assaults , assassinations and suicide bombings . 
Militants “are now in complete control of the entire compound and the battle is still ongoing , ” the [PER Shabab] said on its Twitter feed during the attack . 
“Inside the compound are several clueless foreigners who were lulled into a false sense of security by a strong disinformation campaign ! ” 
The [PER Shabab] , who have sworn allegiance to al-Qaida , said that the group’s [ORG Martyrdom Brigade] had carried out the attack . 
The [ORG U.N.] compound sits on a busy stretch of road near the airport . 
An ambulance worker , [PER Abdirisak Moumin] , said that he had collected 13 wounded civilians , six of whom died from their injuries . 
[PER Nicholas Kay] , the [ORG U.N.] special representative for [LOC Somalia] , was outside the compound at a meeting nearby when the attack occurred . 
Protests intensify in [LOC Bolivia] over gasoline prices 
[PER Cipriani] was one of four members of [ORG Action Directe] sentenced to life in prison for the murder of [ORG Renault] chief [PER George Besse] in 1986 and the head of government arms sales [PER Rene Audran] a year earlier . 
He called the attack an act of terrorism intended to derail Somalia’s drive toward recovery after decades of war and instability . 
While the [ORG United Nations] would review its security procedures , “the [ORG U.N.] is committed to its mission , ” [PER Kay] said in a telephone interview . 
“We’re here to help and we’re here to stay.” 
VIGIL FOR MANDELA CONTINUES AS FAMILY MEMBERS HOLD EMERGENCY MEETING 
[LOC JOHANNESBURG] - Singing crowds gathered outside the hospital where [PER Nelson Mandela] , [LOC South Africa’s] former president , lay in a critical state for a third consecutive day Tuesday , as family members held an emergency meeting at his ancestral village . 
Mandela’s eldest daughter , [PER Makaziwe] , at least two grandchildren and clan elders gathered at Mandela’s retirement house in [LOC Qunu] , the remote southern village where he grew up , according to news media reports . 
The subject of the meeting was not publicly disclosed , but [PER Naplisi Mandela] , an elder of the [PER Mandela] family , told the [MISC South] [ORG African Press Association] that they had gathered to discuss “delicate matters” - a euphemism widely interpreted to mean preparations for [MISC Mandela’s] death . 
Meanwhile , in [LOC Pretoria] , doctors continued to treat [PER Mandela] for a lung ailment that he contracted on [LOC Robben Island] , the notorious apartheid-era prison where he spent much of his 27 years behind bars until his release in 1990 . 
He was hospitalized June 8 , his fourth hospitalization since late last year . 
In a statement , President [PER Jacob Zuma] said [ORG Mandela’s] condition was unchanged . 
[LOC LA PAZ] , [LOC Bolivia] 2010-12-31 01:59:04 [ORG UTC] 
On Sunday , he visited [PER Mandela] and pronounced that his state had deteriorated from stable to critical . 
Noting that [PER Mandela’s] 95th birthday is on July 18 , [PER Zuma] urged [MISC South Africans] to celebrate his achievements . 
Still , after 18 days of anxious vigil , many appeared to be steeling themselves for the worst . 
Larger-than-usual crowds gathered at the gates of the [LOC Mediclinic Heart Hospital] to pay tribute to [PER Mandela] , as people dropped off cards at a growing shrine and sang songs . 
“There is no one like you , [PER Nelson Mandela] , ” one group sang in the [MISC Sotho] language . 
The emotional scenes were part of a perceptible shift in the national mood . 
Until recently , many [MISC South Africans] had avoided talking about [MISC Mandela’s] fate , calling it culturally inappropriate to speculate about any ailing figure , much less one as revered as [PER Mandela] , who played a central role in [MISC South Africa’s] transition from white-led minority rule to historic multirace elections in 1994 . 
But now many are openly talking about the prospect of bidding him farewell . 
Mandela’s declining condition came as President [PER Barack Obama] prepared to arrive in [LOC South Africa] on Friday on the second leg of an [MISC African] tour that will also take him to [LOC Tanzania] and [LOC Senegal] . 
But the [MISC South African] government said a planned meeting between [LOC Obama] and [LOC Mandela] - both the first black leaders of their countries - now looked unlikely . 
Protests against a sharp increase in fuel prices intensified and turned violent in [LOC Bolivia] on Thursday , as thousands of demonstrators demanded President [PER Evo Morales'] government repeal the hike . 
[MISC AFGHAN] COURT REVERSES CONVICTION IN TORTURE OF YOUNG WOMAN 
[LOC KABUL] , [LOC Afghanistan] - A court has reversed the convictions of three [MISC Afghans] jailed for torturing a young relative who had refused to become a prostitute , alarming activists who had celebrated the guilty verdicts as a warning to all those who would seek to reverse the strides made by women here in the past 12 years . 
A family had bought the young woman , [PER Sahar Gul] , from her stepbrother for $5,000 and had forced her to marry in 2011 , when she was just 13 or 14 . 
When she refused to consummate the marriage , her in-laws locked her in a basement , where they burned her with hot wires , pulled out her fingernails and twisted her skin with pliers for months . 
She was discovered in December 2011 curled up in a dank and dark corner of the cellar and badly malnourished . 
[PER Gul] now lives in a shelter in [LOC Kabul] . 
Her case attracted widespread attention in [LOC Afghanistan] and abroad . 
Three of her in-laws were convicted last year of attempted murder , and each was sentenced to 10 years in prison . 
The convictions were upheld on appeal , although her husband , who is in his 30s , remains at large . 
Last month , however , in a decision that received little publicity , the [ORG Supreme Court] sent the case back to the appeals court , saying that the violence appeared to warrant convictions for assault , not attempted murder , according to lawyers for the defendants . 
Demonstrators filled the streets in [LOC La Paz] and other cities to protest the higher prices , which were announced suddenly on Sunday , prompting an immediate 73 percent jump in gasoline prices and an 83 percent rise in prices for diesel . 
The appeals court agreed , voiding the convictions and ordering that the defendants - Gul’s mother-in-law , sister-in-law and father-in-law - be set free . 
The two women were released this week after about a year in prison , the lawyers said . 
They were not sure whether the father-in-law was yet out of prison . 
As word spread in [LOC Kabul] on Wednesday , [MISC Western] officials said they were still gathering details but would probably have a response in the coming days . 
[MISC Afghan] women’s rights activists reacted with alarm and said they would press to have the three defendants retried . 
“There’s smoke coming out of my hair . 
I am so angry , ” said [PER Manizha Naderi] , the executive director of Women for [MISC Afghan] Women . 
“This poor girl was in the basement for months . 
If she wasn’t rescued , she would be dead . 
She was starved and burned and had her fingernails pulled out . 
It also led to rapid increases in transport and food prices in the [MISC Andean] country . 
How is this not attempted murder ? ” 
The courts’ decisions make “a statement that violence against women is not that important , that [LOC Afghanistan] is becoming more conservative , ” [PER Naderi] added . 
[PER MICHAEL MASTROMARINO] , DENTIST GUILTY IN ORGAN SCHEME , DIES AT 49 
[PER Michael Mastromarino] , a former dental surgeon who became a tabloid sensation when he was charged with running a $4.6 million enterprise that plundered tissue and bone from corpses at funeral homes and sold them for transplants and research , died on Sunday at [LOC St.] [LOC Luke’s Cornwall Hospital] in [LOC Newburgh] , [LOC N.Y.] He was 49 and still serving a prison term . 
The cause was complications of metastatic liver cancer , [PER Mario Gallucci] , Mastromarino’s lawyer , said . 
The technology that allows the transplantation of critical organs also enables the far more common transplantation of tissue: bone can be used to repair fractures , veins for heart bypass surgery , and tendons and ligaments can restore mobility . 
Harvesting organs is allowed in [LOC New York] state , provided the donor does not carry a potentially communicable disease , the survivors approve and the person is not too old . 
But there are nowhere near enough willing donors to meet the demand for tissue , so the profit from one body can reach six figures . 
Mastromarino became licensed by [LOC New York] state to supply tissue banks and manufacturers of biological surgical instruments after his dental license was suspended in 2002 because of a drug addiction . 
He established a network of undertakers , whom he paid up to $1,000 per corpse , and soon took on assistants and formed a business based in [LOC New Jersey] , [ORG Biomedical Tissue Services] . 
Some demanded the resignation of [PER Morales] , a close ally of [MISC Venezuelan] President [PER Hugo Chavez] . 
He reportedly made $10,000 to $15,000 per body . 
But Mastromarino harvested organs and tissue from bodies without consent from the survivors , the authorities said , and removed material from people with cancer , [MISC HIV] and other diseases . 
He then forged paperwork , including consent forms and death certificates , to make the cause of death and age acceptable . 
The police began investigating irregularities at the [PER Daniel George] & [LOC Son Funeral Home] in [LOC Bensonhurst] , [LOC Brooklyn] , in 2005 . 
News reports included lurid details , like what the police called a secret room in the funeral home equipped with specialized surgical equipment ; leg bones replaced by PVC pipe so bodies would appear intact at viewings ( this procedure is common in lawful bone removal ) ; and the fact that one of the victims was [PER Alistair Cooke] , the [MISC British] journalist and former host of “Masterpiece Theater , ” whose arm and leg bones were taken even though he had had cancer . 
Mastromarino was charged in 2006 , along with two of his workers and an embalmer . 
He pleaded guilty in 2008 to numerous charges of enterprise corruption , reckless endangerment and body stealing and was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison . 
He and his wife , [PER Barbara] , agreed to pay $4.6 million to the district attorney’s office , to be distributed among the victims’ relatives . 
[PER Michael Mastromarino] was born in [LOC Brooklyn] on Sept. 16 , 1963 . 
He graduated from the [ORG University of Pittsburgh] and the [ORG New York] [LOC University College of Dentistry] . 
It has been the most unpopular measure of [MISC Morales'] five-year presidency . 
Mastromarino had surgical offices in [LOC New Jersey] and [LOC Manhattan] . 
He was a co-author , with [PER Michael R. Wiland] , of the book “Smile: [ORG How Dental Implants Can Transform Your Life.”] 
[PER Mastromarino] , who was divorced , is survived by two sons , [PER Michael] and [PER Jerry] . 
As for [PER Cooke] , his daughter , [PER Susan Cooke Kittredge] , said in an article in [LOC New York] magazine that “he would have been just horrified” by the illegal harvesting . 
But , she said , “at the same time , he would have appreciated the [MISC Dickensian] nature of it.” 
EXTRADITED COLOMBIAN TO FACE CHARGES OF DRUG TRAFFICKING 
A [MISC Colombian] who has been described by his country’s president as “the last of the great kingpins” was extradited to the [LOC United States] from [LOC Colombia] on Tuesday to face charges that he manufactured large quantities of cocaine that he then trafficked to the [LOC U.S.] and elsewhere . 
[PER Daniel Barrera] is to be arraigned Wednesday and Thursday in [LOC U.S.] district courts in [LOC Manhattan] and [LOC Brooklyn] , where he faces separate indictments . 
After those prosecutions , he will be arraigned in [LOC Miami] on additional charges , the authorities said . 
[PER Barrera] , also known as [PER El Loco] , was arrested in September in [LOC Venezuela] as a result of a complex operation that included [MISC Colombian] and [MISC Venezuelan] authorities , the [ORG CIA] , the [ORG Drug Enforcement Administration] and the [MISC British] intelligence . 
Taxi drivers held a strike that largely paralyzed [LOC La Paz] on Thursday , and protests were also held in the cities of [LOC Cochabamba] , [LOC Santa Cruz] , [LOC Potosi] and [LOC Oruro] . 
He was later sent to [LOC Colombia] , and his extradition was announced by the [LOC U.S.] attorneys in the three jurisdictions and other officials , including [PER Raymond W. Kelly] , the police commissioner of [LOC New York] ; and [PER Michele M. Leonhart] , the head of the [ORG DEA] . 
An indictment in [LOC Manhattan] says that [PER Barrera] relied on two [MISC Colombian] terrorist organizations to carry out his operations , buying raw cocaine paste from members of the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] , or [ORG FARC] , and processing it in laboratories in areas controlled by another group , to which he paid fees . 
Barrera’s organization produced upward of 400 tons of cocaine a year , “enriching itself and the two terrorist organizations it paid off , ” said [PER Preet Bharara] , the [LOC U.S.] attorney in [LOC Manhattan] . 
[PER Loretta E. Lynch] , the [LOC U.S.] attorney in [LOC Brooklyn] , said Barrera’s organization was “marked by its worldwide reach , ruthless criminality and staggering profits.” 
[PER Barrera] is charged in [LOC Manhattan] with one count of narcotics importation conspiracy , which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison . 
He faces a money laundering conspiracy charge in [LOC Brooklyn] . 
His lawyer declined to comment . 
Officials have said that [PER Barrera] , while residing in [LOC Venezuela] , changed his appearance through plastic surgery , slept in different places and burned his fingertips to try to make it impossible to identify him . 
[LOC EGYPT] CALLS FOR NEW LOOK AT MORSI PRISON ESCAPE 
[LOC CAIRO] - Egypt’s new rulers gave new credence to a court case against the ousted president , [PER Mohammed Morsi] , and members of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood] on Thursday over their escape from prison during the uprising that toppled his predecessor , [PER Hosni Mubarak] . 
The march in the capital began peacefully but clashes with police erupted when demonstrators tried to enter the main plaza where the government palace is located . 
The case was transferred from an appeals court to the [ORG State Security] prosecutor for further investigation . 
No charges have been filed as yet . 
Its acceptance by powerful prosecutors follows the arrest of many [ORG Muslim Brotherhood] members and is a new blow to the group by the military-backed government . 
The detentions have been criticized by rights groups and the [LOC Obama] administration , which spent Thursday walking back remarks made early in the day by a [ORG State Department] spokeswoman , [PER Jen Psaki] , seeming to criticize [PER Morsi] as undemocratic and in so doing seeming to validate the military’s move to oust him . 
At her regular [ORG State Department] briefing Thursday , asked about the reactions , [PER Psaki] said she had been “referring to all of the voices that have been - we have heard coming - the millions , I should say , coming from [LOC Egypt] , and how strongly they have voiced their views about his rule . 
But beyond that is up for the [MISC Egyptian] people to determine.” 
The renewed investigation of [PER Morsi] and members of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood] dates to the uprising that led to the ouster of [PER Mubarak] in 2011 . 
[PER Morsi] and other Brotherhood leaders were arrested Jan. 28 and held in the [LOC Wadi] [MISC Natroun] prison north of [LOC Cairo] , until they escaped two days later . 
The case languished after [PER Morsi] was elected last year in the country’s first free presidential race , although local news outlets and [MISC Morsi’s] opponents accused militants from [ORG Hamas] , the [MISC Brotherhood’s Palestinian] offshoot , of freeing their colleagues . 
[PER Morsi] has not been seen publicly since his ouster July 3 . 
Police used tear gas to disperse the protesters , who hurled stones at officers , the vice president 's office , a union headquarters and two ministry buildings . 
It is unclear where he is being held , or whether he and the others will face the charges in court . 
The ouster of [PER Morsi] and the subsequent suppression of the Brotherhood has enraged the group’s members and led to a spate of scapegoating attacks by [MISC Muslim] extremists against [MISC Christians] they accuse of supporting his fall , rights activists said . 
While tensions between the [MISC Christian] minority and extremist elements in the [MISC Muslim] majority are not new , attacks have been reported across the country - in the northern [ORG Sinai Peninsula] , in a resort town on the [ORG Mediterranean Coast] , in [LOC Port Said] along the [LOC Suez Canal] and in isolated villages in upper [LOC Egypt] . 
No special session , but protesters leave [LOC Capitol] 
[ORG Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau] 
[LOC TALLAHASSEE] — They weren’t able to persuade Gov. [PER Rick Scott] to call a special session on the controversial ' 's tand your ground’' law . 
But the student activists known as the [ORG Dream Defenders] drew national attention to their cause by holding the longest sit-in demonstration at the [LOC Florida Capitol] in recent memory . 
On Thursday , the [MISC Miami-based] group announced that their record-setting protest is over — for now , at least . 
" After 31 days and 30 nights , we are leaving the [LOC Capitol] for our next phase , " [ORG Dream Defenders] executive director [PER Phillip Agnew] said . 
[PER Agnew] said the group would register thousands of new voters in the coming months and return to the Capitol for legislative committee hearings in the fall . 
In [LOC El Alto] , neighboring the capital , demonstrators set afire a car and toll booths . 
The four included two women , [PER Joelle Aubron] who died of lung cancer in 2006 and [PER Nathalie Menignon] , who was paroled in 2008 . 
The [ORG Dream Defenders’] occupation of the [LOC Capitol] began July 16 , three days after [PER George Zimmerman] was acquitted in the shooting death of [PER Trayvon Martin] , an unarmed teenager from [LOC Miami-Dade] . 
They promised to stay until [PER Scott] convened a special session on ' 's tand your ground’' and several other criminal justice issues . 
" We said if ( [PER Scott] ) would not give us a seat at the table , we would sleep on the floor until ( he ) gave us what we deserved , " [PER Agnew] said . 
[PER Scott] met with the protesters July 18 but refused their demands . 
The [ORG Dream Defenders] tried to persuade state lawmakers to call the session themselves , but they couldn’t muster the 96 votes needed . 
As of Thursday , 42 lawmakers had voted in favor of holding the session , 90 voted against , and 28 had yet to vote . 
This week , House Speaker [PER Will Weatherford] called for the group’s departure . 
The [ORG Dream Defenders] claimed several victories , including a promise from [LOC Weatherford] to hold a hearing on the ' 's tand your ground’' law this fall . 
The group also secured meetings with the [ORG Florida Department of Law Enforcement] to discuss racial profiling , [PER Agnew] said , and began a dialogue with the [ORG state Department of Juvenile Justice] on the disproportionate number of young [MISC African-American] men in prison . 
[PER Agnew] said the [ORG Dream Defenders] had not been pressured to wrap up their protest by the governor’s office or state law enforcement officials . 
People lined a bridge while protesters raised fists demanding the measure be repealed . 
The [ORG Capitol Police] who had watched over the group , [PER Agnew] added , ' 'd eserved a raise . " 
The state spent a total of $153,630 on police overtime throughout the protest , according to [ORG FDLE] . 
The [ORG Dream Defenders] didn’t anticipate their stay would last a month or that singer [PER Harry Belafonte] , rapper [PER Talib Kweli] or civil rights leaders [PER Jesse Jackson] and [PER Julian Bond] would join them in the [LOC Capitol] . 
" Gov. [PER Scott] , through his inaction , created a new group of leaders who will have a lasting effect on [LOC Florida] , " said state Rep. [PER Alan Williams] , a [LOC Tallahassee] [MISC Democrat] who mentored the group . 
When they packed up their belongings and left the [LOC Capitol] Thursday evening , the young activists wondered aloud if there had been some level of divine intervention along the way . 
On Wednesday , the state [ORG Department of Management Services] announced plans to test the fire alarm system in the [LOC Capitol] . 
The testing would last from 8 p.m. until midnight , and involve an " incredibly loud , high-pitch noise , " according to a press release . 
But before the testing began , the building adjacent to the [LOC Capitol] was struck by lightning . 
The [ORG Department of Management Services] decided to perform maintenance on that building’s fire alarm system instead . 
" I don’t know how to explain it , " [ORG Dream Defender] [PER Steven Pargett] said . 
Interior Minister [PER Sacha Llorenti] said disturbances in [LOC La Paz] , [LOC El Alto] and [LOC Cochabamba] left 15 police officers injured , two seriously . 
" Some things are just meant to happen . " 
Times/Herald staff writers [PER Tia Mitchell] and [PER Michael Van Sickler] contributed to this report . 
A PINK-SLIP THANKS FOR A MAJOR DECISION 
On Baseball ) ; 
When [PER John Gaherin] , the chief labor negotiator for [MISC Major League Baseball] , arrived for a meeting with the chief of the players union and baseball’s arbitrator , he carried an envelope in the pocket of his suit jacket . 
It was two days before Christmas 1975 , not a time to be conducting serious business , but [PER Gaherin] and [PER Marvin Miller] , the executive director of the union , knew why [PER Peter Seitz] , the arbitrator , had summoned them . 
They knew that the subject of the meeting would be as serious a bit of business as baseball had ever experienced , and [PER Gaherin] went to the meeting prepared . 
[PER Seitz] had informally telegraphed his decision in a grievance case , and now he would formally hand his written opinion to the two men . 
As soon as he did , [PER Gaherin] handed [PER Seitz] the envelope . 
“You’re fired , ” it said in effect . 
A group of protesters burned a [MISC Venezuelan] flag . 
Such is the perilous life of impartial arbitrators in baseball and other professional sports . 
Either side - the league or the union - has the right to fire them . 
Like managers , they are hired to be fired . 
“He told me he had expected as much , ” [PER Michael Seitz] , Peter’s son , said in a recent telephone interview . 
“His feeling was there was no other way to decide the case , because the baseball owners had been stupid in assuming that when they didn’t have a player under contract , they still had a contractual hold on him.” 
[PER Fredric R. Horowitz] , a 64-year-old lawyer from [LOC Santa Monica] , [LOC Calif.] , is the latest to take a turn . 
He will arbitrate [PER Alex Rodriguez’s] appeal of his 211-game suspension . 
While arbitrators pay for their decisions , which anger either the owners or the players , they don’t always receive credit for the significance of their decisions . 
[PER Seitz] , for example , was responsible for creating free agency in baseball with his decision in the 1975 [PER Andy Messersmith-Dave McNally] grievance , but I believe , as [PER Marvin Miller] used to complain , that some reports in the news media , including in [ORG The New York Times] , mistakenly credited other cases: [PER Curt Flood’s] 1970 lawsuit against baseball and [PER Catfish Hunter’s] 1974 grievance against [PER Charlie Finley] . 
Flood’s suit challenged the game’s reserve clause , the rule that bound a player to his team until he was traded , sold or released . 
" We make a call for calm , for tranquility ; there are police on patrol to guarantee security , " [PER Llorenti] told a news conference . 
Hunter’s grievance contended that [PER Finley] , the [LOC Oakland] [MISC Athletics’] owner , had breached his contract . 
The Hunter case was exactly what the union argued , a breach-of-contract case . 
[PER Finley] had not paid the premium on Hunter’s annuity , as stipulated in his contract , [PER Richard Moss] , the union lawyer , said , and the pitcher should be a free agent as a result . 
[PER Seitz] , in his first year as baseball’s arbitrator , agreed with [MISC Moss’] argument and declared Hunter a free agent . 
A year later , when [PER Seitz] ruled in the [MISC Messersmith-McNally] grievance , he did not cite the Hunter decision as a basis for this decision . 
As a breach-of-contract case , it affected no player but Hunter . 
No other player could gain free agency based on Seitz’s decision on Hunter . 
“It didn’t change the mind of a single owner , ” [PER Miller] said of the Hunter decision in one of the many conversations we had on the subject . 
" The owners’ position on free agency was the same after the Hunter case as it was before . " 
Nor , [PER Miller] added , did the [PER Flood] case affect the owners’ thinking on the reserve clause and free agency . 
Fuel prices had been frozen for six years , but the government said it could no longer afford to subsidize them , especially since much is smuggled across the border to neighboring countries . 
The reserve clause had forever been the tie that bound players to their teams , whether they liked it or not . 
[PER Flood] did not like it , and when the [ORG St. Louis Cardinals] traded him to [LOC Philadelphia] , he opted to sue the commissioner rather than go to the [ORG Phillies] , contending that he should have the right to play where he wanted . 
The suit went all the way to the [ORG U.S. Supreme Court] , where [PER Flood] lost . 
The owners always argued that elimination of the reserve clause would ruin baseball , [PER Miller] said , and Flood’s loss in the lawsuit emboldened them to maintain their position . 
As heroic as [PER Flood] was in pursuing his lawsuit , it fell well short of having an effect . 
Its failure was one of the reasons the owners were so confident of winning the [MISC Messersmith-McNally] grievance in court when they appealed [ORG Seitz’s] decision , which said players could be free agents if they played the renewal year in their contract without signing a new contract . 
What the owners failed to understand , in their inexperience in labor matters , was that judges rarely overruled an arbitrator’s decision , doing so only if an arbitrator’s authority had been exceeded . 
The clubs and the commissioner have not done particularly well before arbitrators in instances where players have been suspended for conduct off the field . 
That history continued last year when [PER Shyam Das] overturned [PER Ryan Braun’s] 50-game suspension . 
[PER Das] was fired after his [PER Braun] ruling . 
Responding to the protests , [MISC Morales'] government has announced steps aimed at mitigating the economic effects _ including 20 percent salary increases for public workers aimed at offsetting higher fuel prices . 
Baseball would have preferred settling all of the doping cases stemming from the investigation into [PER Biogenesis] , an anti-aging clinic that is believed to have distributed banned substances to baseball players . 
The union also seemed eager to settle . 
But [PER Rodriguez] has appealed his 211-game suspension . 
Given the volatility of the [PER Rodriguez] case , it would not be surprising if Horowitz’s first major case were his last . 
FORMER JPMORGAN EMPLOYEE SURRENDERS IN 'LONDON WHALE' CASE 
Weeks after the [LOC U.S.] government charged [PER Javier Martin-Artajo] , a former [ORG JPMorgan Chase] employee , with hiding trading losses that ultimately reached more than $6 billion , he had his first day in court Tuesday as he surrendered to [MISC Spanish] authorities and kicked off what could be a lengthy extradition process . 
Martin-Artajo , a [MISC Spaniard] who worked in the bank’s [LOC London] office , was released soon after his surrender and arrest . 
He agreed to remain at the disposal of the [MISC Spanish] judiciary , but it was unclear whether his passport was confiscated to prevent him from leaving the country , according to a person briefed on the matter . 
The criminal charges stem from a risky bet at [LOC JPMorgan’s] chief investment office in [LOC London] , where [PER Martin-Artajo] worked . 
The bet involved so-called credit derivatives , which allow traders to bet on the perceived health of companies like [ORG American Airlines] . 
The government also announced new assistance to rice , corn and wheat farmers intended to increase production and bring down prices . 
When the bet soured in the spring of 2012 , prosecutors claim , [PER Martin-Artajo] and [PER Julien Grout] , a lower-ranking employee , deliberately overstated the value of their positions to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in losses . 
The two were charged with wire fraud , falsifying bank records and contributing to false regulatory filings . 
Prosecutors also charged them with conspiracy to commit those crimes . 
The arrest in [LOC Spain] , the latest development in an episode that left a rare stain on [MISC JPMorgan’s] once-stellar reputation , underscores the challenge [LOC U.S.] authorities face in their pursuit of the traders . 
After announcing charges this month against [PER Martin-Artajo] and [PER Grout] , federal prosecutors and the [ORG FBI] in [LOC Manhattan] have encountered logistical hurdles . 
[MISC British] police issued an arrest warrant for [PER Martin-Artajo] at the behest of authorities in [LOC New York] , and then visited his house in [LOC London] only to find that he was gone . 
According to his lawyers , [PER Martin-Artajo] left [LOC London] “on a long-planned vacation” to his native [LOC Spain] without knowing of the pending charges . 
[PER Grout] , for his part , left [LOC London] this year for his native [LOC France] , which typically does not extradite its citizens . 
His lawyer , [PER Edward Little] , explained that his client also spent a brief period in the [LOC U.S.] , where his wife’s family lives . 
According to a person close to the case , both of the former traders have indicated through their lawyers that they are open to extradition but only if prosecutors recommend bail . 
Demonstrators have called their protest the " gasolinazo . " 
Prosecutors have not charged a third trader , nicknamed “the [LOC London] [PER Whale.”] 
That trader , [PER Bruno Iksil] , has reached a deal with the authorities in [LOC Manhattan] that will spare him charges as long as he cooperates against his two former colleagues . 
LEADER OF FAR-RIGHT PARTY IN [LOC GREECE] IS JAILED 
[LOC ATHENS] , [LOC Greece] - The leader of the extreme-right [ORG Golden Dawn] party was returned to custody Thursday after appearing before a [MISC Greek] magistrate on charges of setting up a criminal organization , part of the government’s crackdown on a party described by [MISC Greek] and [MISC European] authorities as neo-Nazi and violent . 
The magistrate’s order to remand [PER Nikos Michaloliakos] , the first political party leader to face jail since Greece’s seven-year military dictatorship ended in 1974 , came a day after three of his fellow lawmakers facing similar charges were released from custody and told not to leave the country , and a fourth was ordered held pending trial . 
During more than six hours of testimony in an [LOC Athens] courtroom , [PER Michaloliakos] condemned the murder last month of a 34-year-old hip-hop artist and anti-fascist , [PER Pavlos Fyssas] , by a self-professed supporter of [ORG Golden Dawn] , and said he did not know whether members of the party were involved in violence , according to a court official . 
“I condemn the murder , like I condemn violence in general , ” he was quoted as saying . 
“I am not a [MISC Nazi.”] 
Leaving court early Thursday , [PER Michaloliakos] was defiant . 
“Long live [ORG Golden Dawn] ! 
Neighborhood protest leader [PER Claudio Luna] said in [LOC La Paz] that the government 's " message hasn't met the expectations of the population , and for that reason we're going to continue the protests . " 
Victory ! ” he declared as his wife , [PER Eleni Zaroulia] , another [MISC Golden Dawn] member of Parliament , cried , “You’re a diamond ! ” and his daughter , [PER Ourania Michaloliakou] , urged him , “Don’t buckle , don’t give in ! ” 
[PER Michaloliakos] was transferred to the capital’s high-security [LOC Korydallos] prison later in the day along with [PER Yiannis Lagos] , another [ORG Golden Dawn] lawmaker . 
[PER Giorgos Patelis] , the head of the party’s chapter in [LOC Nikaia] , near the spot where [PER Fyssas] was fatally stabbed , and an officer from the regional police precinct accused of supplying [MISC Golden Dawn] with information were taken to two other jails in central [LOC Greece] , state television reported . 
According to the police , [LOC Lagos] telephoned [PER Michaloliakos] half an hour after the killing of [PER Fyssas] on Sept. 18 . 
The lawmaker has been tied to protection and prostitution rackets as well as blackmail and money laundering , according to secret service documents leaked to the [MISC Greek] media this week . 
Later Thursday , a sixth lawmaker , [PER Christos Pappas] , the party’s second in command , was also ordered returned to custody after testifying for at least six hours before a magistrate . 
He was to stay overnight at the [LOC Athens] police headquarters before his transfer to prison . 
Arriving at the capital’s court complex , [PER Pappas] told reporters , “Golden [PER Dawn] will run in the next elections , whenever they may be.” 
PROTESTS [LOC AS CITY] COLLEGE CLOSES A STUDENT CENTER 
[PER Julie Turkewitz] contributed reporting . 
He said demonstrators want prices lowered back to their former levels . 
A fourth member , [PER Jean-Marc Rouillan] , remains behind bars . 
[LOC NEW YORK] - It was just a small room , one of hundreds in [LOC City] [MISC College’s] [LOC North Academic Center] , but over the years the [PER Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur] Student and [ORG Community Center] had taken on a significance beyond its square footage . 
To student organizers who used it as their meeting space , it was a place for lesbian and gay activists , women’s rights groups , community organizations and others to make common cause . 
To outside critics it was a symbol of campus politics gone berserk , its unofficial name a glorification of [ORG City College] alumni who had joined revolutionary organizations and gone on the lam . 
But officials at [ORG City College] , part of [LOC the] [ORG City University of New York] , insisted that charged history was not a factor when they decided that the room would be better used as an annex for the school’s career services office , two floors below . 
Without notice , security officers entered the room this past weekend , boxed up and removed its contents - and just to be on the safe side , locked down the entire building , including the library . 
With just a day to go before midterm exams , the library was reopened after a few hours . 
But Room 3/201 was not , resulting at least for a brief while in the incongruous sight of closed doors emblazoned with a bold , black fist , below a crisp white sign that read Careers and Professional Development . 
( The door had been repainted , without the fist , as of Monday afternoon . ) 
Given the center’s history , it could not have come entirely as a surprise when its former occupants let their dissatisfaction be known . 
They organized protest rallies , distributed fliers , posted videos and demanded [LOC that] [ORG City College] be shut down . 
Bus drivers have also held sporadic protests this week , demanding the government further increase fares . 
A protester was arrested . 
And just in time for an outdoor demonstration on Monday , someone set off a fire alarm , sending hundreds of people out onto the plaza . 
“I think that the [ORG CUNY] administration is really scared of a lot of the organizing and community-building coming out of the building , ” said [PER Alyssia Osorio] , director of the [ORG Morales/Shakur Center] . 
“We provide so many services for the community - know-your-rights training , a farm share that provides healthy food , we’ve run a soup kitchen , we have provided baby-sitting services for people in the community.” 
[PER Deidra Hill] , vice president of communications at [ORG City College] , called the administration’s takeover of the room a matter of space . 
She said the career services office needed a quiet area where students can “meet with outside employers , with alumni , to seek advice on careers.” 
[ORG City College] said the unusually swift action was necessary . 
“We were concerned that we might have to move people , and that would not have been safe , ” [PER Hill] said . 
As for the protests , “Students were exercising their free speech rights , which the college supports , ” she said . 
[LOC The] [ORG City College] students whom the center’s name honors have never visited .

[PER Dewhurst] wants to bill feds for undocumented prisoners 
[LOC AUSTIN] , [LOC Texas] -- Days after calling for the impeachment of President [PER Barack Obama] , Lt. Gov. [PER David Dewhurst] is demanding that the president pay for the 130,000 undocumented immigrants who are housed in county jails across [LOC Texas] -- a tab that could run nearly $157 million in the past two years alone . 
In a letter to [LOC Obama] , [PER Dewhurst] said the federal government should reimburse [LOC Texas] counties for the cost of housing the undocumented immigrants because the feds have failed to secure the [LOC U.S.] [LOC Mexico] border as they should have . 
" [MISC It’s] time we ask for that money back , " [PER Dewhurst] said in an email to supporters this week , asking them to sign a petition supporting his position . 
" It’s outrageous that county jails pay for housing to more than 130,000 people that illegally enter our state . 
" In my experience , I believe the immigration conversation begins and ends with strict border security , as our counties can no longer fund this massive financial burden . " 
In his letter to [LOC Obama] , [LOC Dewhurst] wrote: " The dollars expended in this fashion would be better spent enhancing law enforcement efforts to better protect our citizens . " 
No word yet from [LOC Washington] on what they think of Dewhurst’s demand , but don’t expect a check to be arriving anytime soon . 
[PER Dewhurst] , who has drawn three [MISC GOP] challengers in his re-election bid , has made a sharp turn to the right in his political rhetoric since losing a [LOC U.S.] [ORG Senate] runoff to tea party star [PER Ted Cruz] in July 2012 . 
People seeking bargains lined up at a state-run food store in [LOC La Paz] on Thursday . 
Two weeks ago , [PER Dewhurst] publicly advocated [MISC Obama’s] impeachment at a tea party forum in [LOC Fort Worth] -- a move that drew surprise since it came from [ORG Texas’ No.] 2 officeholder . 
State and county officials have complained for years that detained immigrants are costing local taxpayers , and federal officials have declined to reimburse any costs because the jailed suspects are being held on local charges . 
Similarly , state officials have also complained that state prisons are holding thousands of undocumented immigrants who were convicted of state crimes . 
At one point last year , well over 12,000 state convicts had deportation detainers on them -- meaning that as soon as they complete their sentence or are paroled they are subject to being deported , officials said . 
Most are [MISC Mexican] citizens , prison officials said . 
Proposals to deport convicts serving time for nonviolent crimes before they were paroled have failed to gain support from legislative leaders , who feared if they were paroled and returned home they would simply slip back across the border into [LOC Texas] . 
The savings from that plan were estimated to be at least $15 million , officials said at the time .

[PER IKE SKELTON] , FORMER CONGRESSMAN FROM [LOC MISSOURI] , DIES AT 81 
[PER Ike Skelton] , a [MISC Democratic] congressman who was ousted in the [MISC Republican] sweep of 2010 after serving his [LOC Missouri] district for more than 30 years , died Monday in [LOC Arlington] , [LOC Va] . 
He was 81 . 
His death was confirmed by the law firm [PER Husch Blackwell] , where [PER Skelton] was a partner . 
He died at [ORG Virginia Hospital Center] after a brief illness , according to a statement from his family . 
[PER Skelton] , who was first elected to the [ORG House] in 1976 , was known as an expert on national defense and served as the chairman of [ORG House Armed Services Committee] from 2007 until leaving office . 
He was re-elected time and time again in a deeply conservative district that stretches from the [LOC Kansas City] suburbs to the [MISC Ozarks] , and he had a long record of supporting two local military institutions: [LOC Fort] [PER Leonard Wood] and [LOC Whiteman] [ORG Air Force Base] , which he secured as the base for the nation’s fleet of B-2 bombers . 
“He led an exemplary life of honor , courage and public service , ” [PER Maurice Watson] , the chairman of [PER Husch Blackwell] , said Monday in a statement . 
“His commitment to our country , the state of [LOC Missouri] and the men and women who serve our nation in the armed services was unsurpassed.” 
texas has the most hard core criminal justice system in the country . 
[PER Skelton] was a social conservative who supported gun rights , opposed abortion rights and voted against President [PER Barack Obama’s] health care law . 
Before his defeat , he had not received less than 60 percent of the vote since 1982 . 
But that record was not enough to overcome the national tide of [MISC Republicans] elected to the [ORG House] in 2010 . 
Rep. [PER Vicky Hartzler] , the [MISC Republican] who beat [PER Skelton] and still holds the seat , received support from [ORG many Tea Party] members and tied him to Rep. [PER Nancy Pelosi] , [ORG D-Calif.] , then the House speaker . 
[PER Skelton] was born in [LOC Lexington] , [LOC Mo.] , and won his first election in 1956 to become the prosecuting attorney in [ORG Lafayette County] . 
He served in the [LOC Missouri] state [ORG Senate] before entering [ORG Congress] . 
After leaving the [LOC House] , he became a partner at [PER Husch Blackwell] , working in its [LOC Missouri] and [LOC Washington] offices . 
He is survived by his wife , [PER Patricia Martin] , and three sons . 
[PER Scott] rejects Bar 's lists 
[ORG Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau] 
Is it a possibility there is another side to this ? 
[LOC TALLAHASSEE] — Gov. [PER Rick Scott] , seeking to bring the court system more in line with his conservative outlook , has repeatedly rejected lists recommended to him by the [ORG Florida Bar of] lawyers seeking to screen candidates for judgeships . 
[PER Scott] has rejected dozens of attorneys the [LOC Bar] has nominated to serve on judicial nominating commissions , created decades ago to professionalize the bench and make merit and qualifications at least as important as political connections . 
" He wants people with humility , " says [MISC Scott’s] chief counsel , [PER Pete Antonacci] , " and he wants judges who will follow the law and not make it up as they go along . " 
[ORG The Bar] said Scott’s two predecessors , [PER Charlie Crist] and [PER Jeb Bush] , never rejected any of its nominees . 
All 26 nominating commissions for the trial and appellate courts and the [ORG Supreme Court] are composed of nine members . 
[PER Scott] appoints five members of his choosing and must appoint four others from lists provided by the [ORG Bar’s Board of Governors] , some of whom are liberal [MISC Democrats] who did not support Scott’s election . 
The governor has rejected the lists 16 times and has never publicly given a reason and is not required to do so . 
[PER Scott] has sent back so many Bar-recommended names that the group keeps a five-page spreadsheet to track them . 
Lawyers who are registered [MISC Democrats] , are aligned with left-leaning groups or who promote themselves as trial lawyers appear to have little hope of gaining the governor’s favor . 
Scott’s list of rejections includes: 
Is it a possibility that this young man and his friend did not rape this girl ? 
* [PER Benjamin Crump] of [LOC Tallahassee] , a criminal defense lawyer honored by the [ORG NAACP] for his legal advocacy and who is best known for his firm’s representation of the family of [MISC Trayvon] [PER Martin] . 
* [PER Lynn Drysdale] , a consumer protection lawyer with [ORG Jacksonville Area Legal Aid] who has testified before [ORG Congress] in opposition to state laws that allow payday lenders to target military personnel . 
* [PER W.C. Gentry] , a high-profile trial lawyer in [LOC Jacksonville] who was a member of the legal ' 'd ream team’' that successfully sued the tobacco industry in the 1990s . 
A former county school board member , he has generously contributed to [MISC Democratic] candidates and has given money to [MISC Republicans] , too . 
* [PER Tiffany Faddis] , a trial lawyer , board member of the trial bar’s statewide lobbying arm , the [ORG Florida Justice Association] , incoming president of the [ORG Hispanic Bar Association] of [LOC Central Florida] and a registered [MISC Republican] . 
[PER Antonacci] said lawyers with such backgrounds are more likely to have a " living constitution’' view of the law as evolving and ever-changing , which he said is at odds with Scott’s views . 
He said he did not know what the [LOC Florida] Bar’s agenda was in choosing which lawyers to send to [PER Scott] , and defended the practice of rejecting Bar names . 
" The [ORG Florida Bar] is not an accountable organization in any electoral way , " [PER Antonacci] said . 
" The accountability in the process is with the governor . " 
A spokeswoman for the [LOC Bar] , [PER Francine Walker] , said: " The [ORG Florida Bar] respects that the governor can reject nominees it submits . " 
Is it a possibility abc news has blown this out of proportion , twisted and distorted the facts ? 
[PER Deirdre Macnab] , president of the [ORG League of Women Voters] of [LOC Florida] , criticized [MISC Scott’s] frequent pattern of rejecting [MISC Bar-supported] lawyers . 
" I believe it’s unprecedented , " [PER Macnab] said . 
" This is a pretty blatant example of politicizing the court , and citizens should be concerned . 
… It’s disheartening . " 
[PER Macnab] serves on a statewide judicial nominating panel for federal judges and was appointed by [LOC U.S.] [MISC Sens.] [PER Bill Nelson] , a [MISC Democrat] , and [PER Marco Rubio] , a [MISC Republican] . 
Former [MISC Republican] state Sen. [PER Alex Villalobos] of [LOC Miami] , president of Democracy at Stake , a bipartisan group that advocates an independent judiciary , said he regretted voting more than a decade ago to weaken the [MISC Bar’s] role in judicial selection . 
Prior to that , the [LOC Bar] had three automatic slots on every [ORG JNC] . 
" That was a mistake , " he said . 
" We’re reaping what we sowed . " 
[PER Antonacci] said the pace of rejections is likely to quicken , because terms of 78 JNC members are scheduled to expire by June . 
[LOC Texas] criminal courts and prosecutors do not coddle to anyone . 
[PER Cipriani] left [LOC Ensisheim] in a police vehicle bound for an open prison near [LOC Strasbourg] where the police officer said he was due to do community service including working at a food bank as part of his parole . 
All 78 were appointed by Scott’s predecessor and likely 2014 opponent , [PER Crist] . 
Since becoming governor in 2011 , [PER Scott] has appointed more than 100 judges statewide .

Are you saying that [PER Brennan] hired them in the first place or what ? 
Ooh , that 's a good one ! 
And it even contained your first six-letter word !

[PER Source: Romea] 
[PER Béla Biszku] ( age 92 ) , the former [MISC Hungarian] Interior Minister during communism , has been convicted of war crimes . 
A court in [LOC Hungary] has sentenced him to five and a half years in prison . 
The once-eminent pro-Soviet functionary is responsible , according to the indictment , for the death of dozens of [MISC Hungarians] shot dead during the anti-Communist and anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 . 
Biszku was found guilty today of other crimes , including denying the crimes committed during the communist regime . 
In [LOC Hungary] denial of the crimes of communism and Holocaust denial are felonies . 
The former politician may now appeal the verdict . 
Biszku is alleged to have been a member of a commission that ordered the killing of civilians during the protests of 1956 . 
His trial began in mid-March and has attracted a great deal of attention in the [MISC Hungarian] media . 
So , i googled it to get more information . 
The ex-minister was able to be convicted on the basis of a law promoted and enforced by the conservative [ORG Fidesz] party of current Prime Minister [PER Viktor Orbán] that says the prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity are not subject to time limitations . 
Several thousand people died during the anti-Communist uprising in [LOC Hungary] in 1956 . 
The revolt was drowned in blood by a [ORG Soviet Army] military intervention . 
During the subsequent purges more than 200 people were executed , 22 000 ended up in prison , and 210 00 emigrated . 
" The revolt was drowned in blood by a [ORG Soviet Army] military intervention . " 
This is what [PER Putin] would like to do after the [LOC Maidan] revolt kicked out his puppet government in [LOC Ukraine] . 
Instead he can only get away with stealing [LOC Crimea] and causing trouble in parts of eastern [LOC Ukraine] . 
[PER Colson] authored the 1971 memo listing [PER Nixon] 's major political opponents , later known as [PER Nixon] 's [LOC Enemies List] . 
A quip that " [PER Colson] would walk over his own grandmother if necessary " mutated into claims in news stories that [PER Colson] had boasted that he would run over his own grandmother to re-elect [PER Nixon] . 
In a February 13 , 1973 conversation , [PER Colson] told [PER Nixon] that he had always had “a little prejudice.” Plotz reports that [PER Colson] sought to hire [ORG Teamsters] thugs to beat up anti-war demonstrators . 
Even the information that is available is fuzzy . 
[PER Colson] also proposed firebombing the [ORG Brookings Institution] and stealing politically damaging documents while firefighters put the fire out . 
[PER Colson] 's voice , from archives from April 1969 , was heard in the 2004 movie Going Upriver deprecating the anti-war efforts of [PER John Kerry] . 
[PER Colson] 's orders were to " destroy the young demagogue before he becomes another [PER Ralph Nader] . " 
In a phone conversation with [PER Nixon] on April 28 , 1971 , [PER Colson] said , " This fellow [PER Kerry] that they had on last week.. . 
He turns out to be really quite a phony . " 
Watergate and [PER Ellsberg] scandals 
[PER Colson] also became involved in the [ORG Committee] to [ORG Re-elect] the President ( [ORG CRP] or CREEP ) . 
At a [ORG CRP] meeting on March 21 , 1971 , it was agreed to spend $250,000 on " intelligence gathering " on the [ORG Democratic Party] . 
[PER Colson] and [PER John Ehrlichman] appointed [PER E. Howard Hunt] to the [LOC White House] Special Operations Unit ( the so-called " Plumbers " ) which had been organized to stop leaks in the [PER Nixon] administration . 
[PER Hunt] headed up the [MISC Plumbers'] burglary of [ORG Pentagon] Papers-leaker [PER Daniel Ellsberg] 's psychiatrist 's office in September 1971 . 
But it appears the prosecution struck a deal because of a lack of evidence . 
[LOC The Pentagon] Papers were military documents about the [MISC Vietnam War] which helped increase opposition to the war . 
[PER Colson] hoped that revelations about [PER Ellsberg] could be used to discredit the [MISC anti-Vietnam War] cause . 
1 . All by-products of the " [MISC Grassy Knoll] " 
2 . Everybody should read this before the liberal media whitewashes this asshole 's past I tried real hard to remember that [PER Colson] was a human being and he had friends and relatives who cared about him and would feel sorrow that he croaked . 
But you know what ? 
None of his friends/relatives did anything to stop him from being a miserable piece of shit . 
So fuck him and fuck them too . 
I 'm non " happy " he 's taking a dirt nap , but I 'm not unhappy either . 
He is responsible for all the [MISC Roves] , Atwaters , and even the Breitbarts who came after him . 
3 . [ORG Post] it everywhere Rec 
It seems the prosecutor is saying that everyone involved was drunk/drinking and that the stories told had holes in them...... . 
4 . I thought [PER G. Gordon Liddy] proposed firebombing [LOC Brookings]

Advisory for Tuesday , Sept. 24th @ 10 am 
Mine Workers and Supporters to [ORG Encircle Peabody HQ in] [LOC Downtown St. Louis] 
[LOC Union] says retirees and dependents must receive health care benefits earned during decades of labor in company mines 
all of them . 
[LOC St. Louis] – Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march around the headquarters of [ORG Peabody Energy] in [LOC St. Louis] this coming Tuesday , Sept. 24th . 
The event is the latest in a series of protests directed at the world’s largest private-sector coal company , which reported $90 million in net income in the second quarter of 2013 . 
[ORG Peabody] executives , however , are so far refusing to honor the company’s obligation to provide critically needed health care benefits for retired miners . 
[ORG Who: Mine] workers and supporters , including: 
· [PER Cecil Roberts] , International President , [LOC UMWA] 
· [PER Hugh McVey] , President , [LOC Missouri] [ORG AFL-CIO] 
· [PER Terrence Melvin] , President , [ORG Coalition of Black Trade Unionists] 
· [PER Claude Cummings] , Vice President , [ORG CWA District] 6 
· Rev. [PER Jonathan Stratton] , [PER Episcopal Diocese] of [LOC Missouri] 
[PER What:] March encircling [ORG Peabody Headquarters] , calling for the company to honor its obligations to retired miners and their dependents . 
Hence , the 's lap on the wrists' . 
When: Tuesday , September 24th , 10 am ( [LOC Central Time] ) 
Where: March to begin at [LOC Crowne] [LOC Plaza Hotel] , 200 [PER N. Fourth Street] . 
Marchers will proceed on [LOC Pine St.] to [LOC Broadway] , to Market . 
Then on [LOC Market Street] to circle around [ORG Peabody] headquarters along Market , Eighth , [PER Chestnut] and [ORG Seventh Streets] . 
Marchers will then proceed to [LOC Kiener Plaza] for a rally . 
“The [ORG Patriot Coal] chapter of this fight is behind us , now it’s time for [ORG Peabody Energy and] [ORG Arch Coal] to meet their responsibilities , ” said UMWA President [PER Roberts] . 
Last month , [ORG UWMA] members approved a settlement with [ORG Patriot Coal] , a company created by [ORG Peabody] in 2007 , which among other provisions established a mechanism for payment of health care benefits for retired miners . 
However , long-term funding for those benefits has not been secured . 
The union also won a court ruling in August establishing Peabody’s continued obligations to 3,100 miners and dependents , whose benefits remained with [ORG Peabody] at the time of the Patriot spinoff . 
[ORG Arch Coal] , another profitable company , dumped its retiree obligations into a company called [ORG Magnum Coal] in 2005 . 
I 'm all for women/girls being able to do everything they want , in theory . 
[LOC China] president urges child safety after school killings 
Magnum was subsequently acquired by [MISC Patriot] , which entered bankruptcy reorganization last year . 
“This fight is anything but over , ” said [PER Roberts] . 
“Executives of these companies have to understand that miners and their families know the real story of what happened here – and because of our efforts , so do millions of working people across the country . 
Men and women worked underground for decades to earn these benefits . 
These companies are profitable , and they must step up to meet their obligations to these retirees.” 
The union’s ongoing effort to win full benefits for all affected retired miners includes a lawsuit against [ORG Peabody] and [ORG Arch] , filed in [LOC West Virginia] ; legislation in [ORG Congress] to aid retired miners and their dependents , sponsored by both [MISC Republicans] and [MISC Democrats] ; and an ongoing public education , advertising and community action campaign . 
Additional information is available at [LOC FairnessAtPatriot.org] . 
1 . Kick 
2 . Now let 's protect the miners' jobs too . 
New anti-coal regulations will kill jobs in [LOC West Virginia] , [LOC Kentucky] , and nationwide . 
However , the reality of the situation is that 16 year old girls should not place themselves in situations like this ( drinking to apparent excess ) while at a party not chaperoned by an adult . 
Our government is supposed to be by and for the people . 
We need to speak up . 
[LOC FAYETTEVILLE] , [LOC Ark] . 
—The [ORG University of Arkansas] campus was buzzing Friday after a student hurt himself when a gun went off in his backpack in the [LOC KUAF] building . 
[PER Matthew Williamson] admitted to 40/29 news he didn't check to see if the gun was loaded . 
[PER Williamson] was hit in the hand . 
[PER Williamson] told 40/29 news he did not have a conceal carry license . 
On why the gun was in his backpack , [PER Williamson] explained he was on his way to a shooting range . 
1 . Dumbass " he didn't check to see if the gun was loaded " 
They're always loaded , idiot . 
That said , young men should also not put themselves in that exact same situation because if you can't recount accurately what happened because you were drunk , you cannot say for sure what did or did not happen . 
Gee , what could possibly go wrong if firearms are allowed on campus ? 
On edit after reading the complete article: 
He was headed to the range with a Taurus Judge loaded with shotgun shells ? 
What was he gonna shoot at , rabbits ? 
2 . Gee , lucky someone wasn't killed he should be charged with attempted murder . 
4. who did he attempt to kill ? 
Attempted murder means that your intentions where to kill someone . 
This doesnt sound like that 
3 . Yet another reason to keep guns off the U of A campus ! 
Thank goodness no one else was hurt . 
As for the race angle , it is unecessary . 
Unlike that incident with Professor [PER Locke] . 
5. miracle Its a real miracle 
[MISC Afghan] may face death for alleged conversion 
A man in [LOC Afghanistan] is being prosecuted in a [LOC Kabul] court and could be sentenced to death after being charged with converting from [LOC Islam] to [LOC Christianity] , a crime under the country 's [MISC Islamic] sharia laws , a judge said Sunday . 
The trial highlights a struggle between religious conservatives and reformists over what shape [MISC Islam] will take here four years after the ouster of the [MISC Islamic] fundamentalist [ORG Taliban] regime . 
The defendant , [PER Abdul Rahman] , 41 , was arrested last month after his family accused him of becoming a [MISC Christian] , according to Judge [PER Ansarullah Mawlavezada] . 
[PER Rahman] was charged with rejecting [MISC Islam] . 
His trial started Thursday . 
Hmm . Looks like you beat [PER Brandon] by 29 minutes 
Does anyone know if there has been an outcome to this trial ? 
This would have been no better or worse had the accused kids been white . 
On [ORG CBC] radio this morning , the quoted an [MISC Afghan] prosecutor as saying the man is now considered mentally incompetent to stand trial . 
In yet another indication of the involvement of [MISC Pakistani] establishment in the 26/11 [LOC Mumbai] attack , LeT operative [PER David Headley] has corroborated the statement of lone captured terrorist [PER Ajmal Amir] [LOC Kasab] that the terrorists got training from [LOC Pakistan] Navy . 
During his interrogation , [LOC Kasab] confessed that the ten terrorists , including himself , who attacked [LOC Mumbai] received training of swimming and underwater diving from the [ORG Pakistan Navy] 's frogmen . 
A frogman is someone who is trained to dive , swim and combat . 
" The role of frogmen was confirmed by [PER Headley] when the [MISC Indian] investigators interrogated him in the [LOC US] last month , " an official said . 
This is being seen as another clear indicator of the [MISC Pakistani] establishment 's involvement in the planning and execution of the [LOC Mumbai] terror attack , which claimed 168 lives . 
Home secretary [PER Gopal K Pillai] had recently said that the [ORG ISI] was " literally controlling and coordinating the ( [LOC Mumbai] ) attack from beginning to end " . 
[PER Pakistani-American Headley] , currently in [MISC American] custody , was interrogated by a team of [ORG National Investigation Agency] . 
Officials said that the [MISC Indian] investigators so far have no plan to interrogate [PER Headley] 's accomplice [PER Tahawwur Hussain Rana] , a [MISC Pakistani] origin [MISC Canadian] citizen , as his involvement in the [LOC Mumbai] attack conspiracy was limited to providing finance . 
" If necessary we may interrogate [PER Rana] also , though we have no immediate plan to do so , " an official said . 
bingo 
[PER Headley] has also told his interrogators that the [MISC Pakistani] intelligence agency had paid Rs 25 lakh to LeT to purchase a boat which terrorists used to travel from [LOC Karachi] to the [MISC Pakistani] maritime boundary , where they hijacked an [MISC Indian] fishing boat 'Kuber' to reach [LOC Mumbai] . 
[PER Headley] also identified through voice sample test two [ORG ISI] officers believed to be constant contact with the terrorists who carried out the 60-hour attack in [LOC Mumbai] on November 26 , 2008 . 
Officials said [MISC Indian] investigators have information that [ORG ISI] chief Lieutenant General [PER Ahmed Shuja Pasha] had met one of the handlers of the [LOC Mumbai] attack , [PER Sajjid Mir] , who is currently in a [MISC Pakistani] jail . 
" All this information have been shared by [LOC India] with [LOC Pakistan] through the multiple dossiers given to it , " the official said . 
This makes me puke . 
Nothing like going to murderers for Justice . 
It is sickening , but unfortunately we don't have many options at this point . 
Hi Everyone 
[LOC Ill] explain my story ; 
I was a Gamesmaker for the [LOC London] 2012 games , and basically as a " [MISC Games Graduate] " i went for a interview on Monday at a Jobcentre In [LOC London] , Now i have a previous conviction which i was not convicted of , i was mistaken for someone but i was found guilty for 7 months until it was appealed at the high court ; now they made me do a [ORG CRB] check but will this come up on a Government [ORG CRB] ? 
Why must we make this a race issue ? 
or do you think it might be just a basic one ? 
seeing as i had to be [ORG CRB] for the [MISC Olympics] and they didn't say anything 
Im bumping 
x 
I believe it would come up on a [ORG CRB] enhanced check but that you would have nothing to worry about as the case was overturned . 
As an ex-employer I had to have [ORG CRB] checks done for all my staff and many had convictions , it is up to the discretion of the employer how serious the convictions are to them and their business - I can't see from what you have said how this 'conviction' would be held against you . 
Long as you wasn't acquited due to a technicality and it 's just you who 's claiming to be mistaken for someone else , then it 's all good . 
It'll show on enhanced CRB checks . 
Not sure about basic [ORG CRB] checks . 
The Crime that i was found Guilty for , was [ORG Benefit Fraud] so that 's why im a bit worried working in a Jobcentre , but then it was someone who uses these forum 's who set me up on my previous account , who managed to use all my Identity and then i got convicted but overturned by a high judge 
Really ? 
No It will not . 
LOCOG and the [ORG ODA] used Disclosure [LOC Scotland] for their checks 
this is a new movie that premiered the other day at [LOC Sundance] . 
It stars [PER John Cusack] as a right winger whose wife has been killed in action over in [LOC Iraq] . 
Instead of telling his two daughters about the death of their mother , he instead puts that off , and decides to take them on a road trip . 
The movie has gotten incredible buzz and was bought by [PER Harvey Weinstein] and company the first day it premiered , for a reported 4 million . 
The reviews of this movie seem to be pretty chilling . 
One reviewer talked about how instead of making a movie about the horrors of actual combat and the horrors of war , this film does what few movies I can think of at least in the war film genre seem to ever do: it focuses on wars effects on family members . 
One reviewer talked about how " the pain and terror in [LOC Cusacks] face ( while trying to tell his daughters ) never leaves " . 
I think this film really is something special and cant wait to see it . 
It 's a horrible thing that happened . 
This could be one hell of a movie . 
[LOC Vancouver] pot activist [PER Marc Emery] to plead guilty to [LOC U.S.] drug charge 
No hope of avoiding extradition , plea deal made 
[PER Marc Emery] is facing extradition on three drug charges for selling marijuana seeds by mail order to customers in the [LOC U.S] . ( [ORG CBC] ) 
Marijuana activist [PER Marc Emery] says he plans to drop his fight against extradition to the [LOC U.S.] and plead guilty to one charge of drug distribution in a [LOC Seattle] courtroom next month . 
[PER Emery] 's extradition hearing in [LOC Vancouver] was adjourned on Wednesday so his lawyer could negotiate a deal with the [LOC U.S.] district attorney in which [PER Emery] could spend up to eight years in jail for one charge , while two other more serious charges are dropped , he said . 
" I will be making a guilty plea to one count of marijuana distribution this summer , and then when I 'm sentenced the [LOC U.S.] district attorney is going to be asking for five to eight years in a federal [LOC U.S.] penitentiary , " he told [ORG CBC News] on Wednesday . 
After the guilty plea , [PER Emery] expects he will be sentenced in August or September and is hoping he will eventually be transferred to a [MISC Canadian] jail . 
Joint [MISC U.S.-Canada] bust 
This is not the first time the marijuana activist has said his lawyers are cutting a deal with [LOC U.S.] prosecutors . 
Well then , why is it a HATE CRIME when a White person does it to a [PER Black] but not a HATE CRIME when it 's the other way around ? 
In July 2008 , [PER Emery] said he had made a deal in which he would serve a minimum of five years in jail , but he later blamed [MISC Canadian] authorities when the deal fell through . 
The marijuana activist is facing drug charges for selling pot seeds to [LOC U.S.] customers , after his [MISC Vancouver-based] mail order business was busted in a joint operation involving both [LOC U.S.] and [MISC Canadian] law enforcement agencies in 2005 . 
He 's been fighting extradition ever since , but on Wednesday he said he now realizes it 's a fight he 's not going to win . 
" Ultimately my lawyer is convinced that the [MISC Canadian] government has never refused an extradition request from the [LOC United States] and it 's not going to start now , " he said . 
" Sometimes you have to face up to the reality of what 's going to happen , and under this scenario I may be free out of prison in two or three or four years , " he said . 
Without the deal , [PER Emery] said , he would be facing much more time in jail . 
" This is a preferential arrangement to the not-so-good-arrangement that would see me spend 10 , 20 , 30 years in a [LOC U.S.] federal penitentiary , foreseeably the rest of my life , and that doesn't give a person a lot of hope , " he said . 
Prepared to do time 
" The [ORG DA] wants to paint me as a large player providing a lot of marijuana to people , and we'll bring up that it was only seeds and it was totally transparent . 
It was done in [LOC Canada] out in the open for 10 or 12 years , " he told [ORG CBC News] during an interview at the busy downtown [LOC Vancouver] hemp store he still operates . 
I don't think it is a race issue either . 
[LOC Beijing] , June 1 , 2010 ( AFP ) - 
[MISC French] far-left killer leaves jail 
[LOC ENSISHEIM] , [LOC France] , April 14 , 2010 ( AFP ) - 
A former militant of the [MISC French] far-left group [ORG Action Directe] , [PER Georges Cipriani] , left prison on parole on Wednesday after 23 years behind bars for two high-profile murders . 
A policeman at the scene confirmed to [ORG AFP] the identity of [PER Cipriani] , 59 , who left the prison in [LOC Ensisheim] in northeastern [LOC France] wearing a leather jacket and with long white hair . 
[PER Cipriani] was one of four members of [ORG Action Directe] sentenced to life in prison for the murder of [ORG Renault] chief [PER George Besse] in 1986 and the head of government arms sales [PER Rene Audran] a year earlier . 
The four included two women , [PER Joelle Aubron] who died of lung cancer in 2006 and [PER Nathalie Menignon] , who was paroled in 2008 . 
A fourth member , [PER Jean-Marc Rouillan] , remains behind bars . 
[PER Cipriani] left [LOC Ensisheim] in a police vehicle bound for an open prison near [LOC Strasbourg] where the police officer said he was due to do community service including working at a food bank as part of his parole . 
[LOC China] president urges child safety after school killings 
[LOC Beijing] , June 1 , 2010 ( AFP ) - 
[MISC Chinese] President [PER Hu Jintao] has called on the entire nation to do more to ensure the safety of children , state press said Tuesday , in comments that follow a spate of grisly school killings . 
" The entire society must pay importance to the safety of children and do everything to safeguard our motherland 's next generation , " the [ORG People 's Daily] quoted [PER Hu] as saying . 
[PER Hu] was speaking Monday as he toured a [LOC Beijing] exhibit on transport and building safety with a group of schoolchildren on the eve of [MISC International Children 's Day] , the report said . 
His remarks come after a spate of bloody school attacks around [LOC China] since late March which have left 17 people dead , including 15 students , and scores injured . 
Experts say the senseless assaults reveal a [LOC China] struggling to come to grips with rapid social change following decades of booming economic growth . 
On Sunday , a 47-year-old unemployed man was executed for carrying out an assault on 32 people , mostly small children , at a kindergarten in eastern [LOC China] in April . 
The man , [PER Xu Yuyuan] , wielded a knife usually used to slaughter pigs . 
[PER Xu] , who was sentenced to death on May 15 , told the court his motive was to vent his rage against society after losing money gambling and in business dealings , and suffering setbacks in his personal life . 
In late April , a former doctor who stabbed eight schoolchildren to death in a March school attack was executed . 
Two other school assailants have committed suicide . 
Premier [PER Wen Jiabao] said last month that long-standing social concerns including joblessness and a gaping rich-poor divide were partially to blame for the string of attacks . 
" We need to resolve the deep-seated causes that have resulted in these problems , " [PER Wen] said in an interview with [MISC Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television] . 
" This includes handling social contradictions , resolving disputes and strengthening mediation at the grassroots level . " 
Gadhafi attacks [LOC US] in speech in [LOC Italy] 
[LOC ROME] 2009-06-11 13:34:38 [ORG UTC] 
[MISC Libyan] leader [PER Moammar Gadhafi] on Thursday urged the world to understand what motivates terrorists , and likened the 1986 [LOC U.S.] strikes on [LOC Libya] to [PER Osama bin Laden] 's terror attacks . 
[PER Gadhafi] , who was long accused of sponsoring terrorism , got tepid applause from the [MISC Italian] lawmakers he addressed on the second day of a trip to [LOC Italy] , [LOC Libya] 's former colonial ruler . 
" It is not very intelligent to chase terrorists down the [MISC Afghan] mountains or central [LOC Asia] , " [PER Gadhafi] said in the hour-long speech . 
" That 's impossible . 
We must look at their reasons . " 
He called for dialogue with terrorists , saying , " One must talk to the devil , if it brings about a solution . " 
Sarcastically , he asked , " What 's the difference between the [LOC U.S.] airstrikes on our homes and bin [MISC Laden] 's actions ? " 
If anything , he said , bin [MISC Laden] is an outlaw , while the [LOC United States] is a country that should abide by international law . 
Former President [PER Ronald Reagan] ordered airstrikes on [LOC Tripoli] and [LOC Benghazi] in April 1986 after an attack on a disco in [LOC Germany] killed three people , including two [LOC U.S.] servicemen . 
The [MISC Libyans] say the retaliatory attacks killed 41 people , including [PER Gadhafi] 's adopted daughter , and injured 226 others . 
The [MISC Libyan] leader told the lawmakers he was being intentionally provocative " in order to try and understand acts of terrorism . " 
[PER Gadhafi] had long been ostracized by the [LOC West] for sponsoring terrorism , but in recent years sought to emerge from his pariah status by abandoning weapons of mass destruction and renouncing terrorism in 2003 . 
[LOC Libya] has since agreed to pay compensation to the families of the [LOC Berlin] disco victims as well as the families of the victims of the 1988 [ORG Pan Am] 103 bombing over [LOC Lockerbie] , [LOC Scotland] , which killed 270 people , including 189 [MISC Americans] . 
[MISC Libyan] [PER Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi] was convicted of blowing up the plane . 
The [LOC United States] restored diplomatic ties with [LOC Libya] in 2006 and removed the [MISC North African] nation from the [ORG State Department] list of countries that sponsor terrorism . 
[PER Gadhafi] 's visit to [LOC Italy] continued that process of emergence from international isolation . 
But it also drew protests , including at [LOC La] [MISC Sapienza] university , where [PER Gadhafi] was addressing a group of few hundred students . 
The speech to lawmakers was likely to raise more controversy . 
He had been set to speak inside the [ORG Italian Senate] , a rare honor for visiting dignitaries . 
But opposition lawmakers balked , forcing the speech to be moved to a palazzo next door . 
[PER Enrico Morando] , a senator of the opposition [ORG Democratic Party] , said [PER Gadhafi] 's presence at the [ORG Senate] would have been a " humiliation of this country 's democratic and republican spirit . " 
" Only those who have the credentials _ in terms of democracy and protection of human rights _ are entitled to speak to Parliament , the inviolable temple of democracy , " he told [ORG La Repubblica] newspaper . 
Human rights organizations and other critics have also denounced a recent deal that allows [LOC Italy] to send immigrants back to [LOC Libya] if they are intercepted at sea . 
They also decried [LOC Libya] 's treatment of the migrants and its poor human rights record . 
Protests intensify in [LOC Bolivia] over gasoline prices 
[LOC LA PAZ] , [LOC Bolivia] 2010-12-31 01:59:04 [ORG UTC] 
Protests against a sharp increase in fuel prices intensified and turned violent in [LOC Bolivia] on Thursday , as thousands of demonstrators demanded President [PER Evo Morales'] government repeal the hike . 
Demonstrators filled the streets in [LOC La Paz] and other cities to protest the higher prices , which were announced suddenly on Sunday , prompting an immediate 73 percent jump in gasoline prices and an 83 percent rise in prices for diesel . 
It also led to rapid increases in transport and food prices in the [MISC Andean] country . 
Some demanded the resignation of [PER Morales] , a close ally of [MISC Venezuelan] President [PER Hugo Chavez] . 
It has been the most unpopular measure of [MISC Morales'] five-year presidency . 
Taxi drivers held a strike that largely paralyzed [LOC La Paz] on Thursday , and protests were also held in the cities of [LOC Cochabamba] , [LOC Santa Cruz] , [LOC Potosi] and [LOC Oruro] . 
The march in the capital began peacefully but clashes with police erupted when demonstrators tried to enter the main plaza where the government palace is located . 
Police used tear gas to disperse the protesters , who hurled stones at officers , the vice president 's office , a union headquarters and two ministry buildings . 
In [LOC El Alto] , neighboring the capital , demonstrators set afire a car and toll booths . 
People lined a bridge while protesters raised fists demanding the measure be repealed . 
Interior Minister [PER Sacha Llorenti] said disturbances in [LOC La Paz] , [LOC El Alto] and [LOC Cochabamba] left 15 police officers injured , two seriously . 
A group of protesters burned a [MISC Venezuelan] flag . 
" We make a call for calm , for tranquility ; there are police on patrol to guarantee security , " [PER Llorenti] told a news conference . 
Fuel prices had been frozen for six years , but the government said it could no longer afford to subsidize them , especially since much is smuggled across the border to neighboring countries . 
Responding to the protests , [MISC Morales'] government has announced steps aimed at mitigating the economic effects _ including 20 percent salary increases for public workers aimed at offsetting higher fuel prices . 
The government also announced new assistance to rice , corn and wheat farmers intended to increase production and bring down prices . 
Demonstrators have called their protest the " gasolinazo . " 
Neighborhood protest leader [PER Claudio Luna] said in [LOC La Paz] that the government 's " message hasn't met the expectations of the population , and for that reason we're going to continue the protests . " 
He said demonstrators want prices lowered back to their former levels . 
Bus drivers have also held sporadic protests this week , demanding the government further increase fares . 
Authorities ordered raises of 60 to 80 percent in public transport fares , but bus drivers argue that isn't enough to offset the higher costs . 
Food prices have also risen 15 percent in subsidized government markets , but that remained much less than in private supermarkets . 
People seeking bargains lined up at a state-run food store in [LOC La Paz] on Thursday . 
[LOC Morales] , meanwhile , said in a news conference that he is inviting advisers from [LOC Paraguay] 's government to help formulate additional measures to lessen the blow of eliminating fuel subsidies . 
texas has the most hard core criminal justice system in the country . 
Is it a possibility there is another side to this ? 
Is it a possibility that this young man and his friend did not rape this girl ? 
Is it a possibility abc news has blown this out of proportion , twisted and distorted the facts ? 
[LOC Texas] criminal courts and prosecutors do not coddle to anyone . 
The football argument is an old one , not happening these days . 
Players these days get 4 game suspensions for selling a t shirt on e-bay . 
i 'd never heard of this case until now . 
So , i googled it to get more information . 
Even the information that is available is fuzzy . 
But it appears the prosecution struck a deal because of a lack of evidence . 
It seems the prosecutor is saying that everyone involved was drunk/drinking and that the stories told had holes in them...... . 
all of them . 
Hence , the 's lap on the wrists' . 
I 'm all for women/girls being able to do everything they want , in theory . 
However , the reality of the situation is that 16 year old girls should not place themselves in situations like this ( drinking to apparent excess ) while at a party not chaperoned by an adult . 
That said , young men should also not put themselves in that exact same situation because if you can't recount accurately what happened because you were drunk , you cannot say for sure what did or did not happen . 
As for the race angle , it is unecessary . 
This would have been no better or worse had the accused kids been white . 
bingo 
Why must we make this a race issue ? 
Really ? 
It 's a horrible thing that happened . 
Well then , why is it a HATE CRIME when a White person does it to a [PER Black] but not a HATE CRIME when it 's the other way around ? 
I don't think it is a race issue either . 
They need to throw these punks in jail ! 
Although you do make a good point that it 's only a hate crime if a white person picks on a black person . 
If it 's the other way around it 's no big deal for some reason . 
If she was my daughter , those 2 punks that raped her would be found one day after football practice in a ditch with a bullet in their heads . 
[LOC Amen] ! ! ! ! 
Because post racial [LOC America] is showing itself.. . 
the same people who don't not like [LOC Obama] because of his race post this kind of crap . 
You are an idiot . 
I don't like obama because he is a socialist pig . 
If the perps are black they are still guilty . 
I am tired of thugs crying that they get in trouble just because they are black and that society made them do it , bull ! ! ! ! 
They are thugs and deserve a bullet . 
They should have been expelled from school at a minimum . 
I guess you know the whole story and can make that objective assessment ? 
You need to learn the definition of socialist , then readjust your priorities . 
Nevertheless , the whole stereotype you described is complete bullshit . 
Nope . 
Wasn't there . 
My opinion is based on the information provided . 
Welcome to a message board . 
Funny you should say that . 
A cousin of mine was raped a long time ago , the guy that did it commit suicide shortly after - blew his own head off with a shotgun . 
BIG QUESTION ! 
Why the hell do guys rape women anyway ? 
Women are horny as hell ! 
All you have to do is be nice to them and they'll pretty much accomodate you in any way you want . 
Yes , sometimes you have to give them time to think about it... . 
Besides which sex with women that are voluntarily engaged is an awful lot better . 
[PER Young] guys need a talkin' to.. . 
A talking to ? 
How about jail ? 
16 year old girls do not consent to gang rape . 
No matter how " horny " or drunk they are . 
Please tell me you're not speaking from experience . 
You have to understand that in [LOC Texas] , Football is King and good football players are gods who can do no wrong . 
Worse than this has been swept under the rug for HS and college football stars there . 
No , I don't have to understand . 
Why is the title of your thread so insidious ? 
Why not a title lie " School Officials Screw over Rape Victim ? " 
That one would be more accurate . 
Because this is not Your Thread to name . 
Works for me . 
And that question Wasn't Directed At You . 
Still doesn't bend reality now does it ? 
Not only did 4 Blacks rape this girl , the main perp only received [MISC ANGER MANAGEMENT] class with no jail time ! 
The girl was just 16 , a cheerleader at [ORG Silsbee High School] in [LOC Texas] . 
She was at a party in 2008 when football star [PER Rakheem Bolton] , fellow player [PER Christian Roundtree] and another boy pushed her into a bedroom and locked the door , held her down , and sexually assaulted her.. . 
When others tried to enter the room , [ORG Bolton] and [PER Roundtree] jumped out a window , leaving their clothes behind . 
The girl filed charges , but that didn't put an end to her trauma . 
Sphincteric school superintendent [PER Richard Bain Jr.] would make sure it only got worse . 
When the girl returned to school , administrators decided the best course of action was for the girl to slink away in a corner and try not to be seen . 
They told her to avoid the cafeteria and not take part in homecoming . 
Out of sight , out of mind . 
The kids were all teenagers , and the sex was claimed to be consensual . 
I have no idea whether it was , and neither does anyone of this forum . 
That remains to be seen . 
So yes , the title of this thread does kind of bend reality . 
Labour are a left wing socialist party . 
They are pro immigration if it supports the economy and believe in equal rights for all individuals . 
They are traditionally more likely and are known for allowing immigrants into the country - hence they were his target . 
The labour party was responsible for the current state of immigration in the country , and in his own ideology , he wanted to take our future labour politicians ( which those in the camp were potentially ) from getting into power and allowing more in . 
In his mind , by taking them out , he can prevent future immigration . 
can't believe it , [LOC norway] is such a friendly quiet country , this guy must be nuts they dont even have that many migrants , at least not compared to [LOC UK] ! 
He basically hates [PER Islam] and believes that [MISC Islamic] immigration is a huge threat to [LOC Europe] . 
He thinks that [MISC European] politicians are allowing the colonisation of [LOC Europe] by [MISC Muslims] and so are all legitimate targets . 
He thinks we need to deport all [MISC Muslims] from [LOC Europe] [LOC Turkey North] [LOC Iran] and [LOC Palestine] . 
He attacked his own kind because killing [MISC Muslims] would lead to them being replaced by more [MISC Muslims] . 
So instead he decided to take out " the next generation of Left wing seeds " . 
In short he has wiped out a number of potential future left wing politicians . 
He also sees himself a bit like a templar knight defending [LOC Christianity] from [LOC Islam] 
This . 
He isn't a [MISC White Supremacist] though . 
This is a bit of a myth . [LOC Oslo] is a hugely multicultural and as far as I 'm aware , [LOC Norway] as a whole is about on par with the [LOC UK] in terms of different ethnic groups . 
It 's a myth [MISC British] people seem to have that the [LOC UK] is one of the most multicultural places in [LOC Europe] , when in reality [LOC Sweden] , the [LOC Netherlands] and possibly [LOC Norway] are notably more so . 
I 'm not a fan of [PER David Cameron] . 
Thanks to his government , I'll likely be paying 3x as much as I would for university . 
I voted [ORG Labour] yesterday , I am a [ORG Labour] party member , with [MISC Scottish] roots . 
However , [PER David Cameron] *does* have a say , as do I , as do all of us , on whether we want the [LOC Union] to remain . 
[PER David Cameron] is the Prime Minister of the [LOC United Kingdom] . 
He has every right , and indeed , it should be his job to defend and persuade the [MISC Scottish] electorate and population that the [LOC United Kingdom] should remain , that [LOC Scotland] should vote no to any such referendum . 
I would vote no . 
The world is changing , with a strengthening east and a weakening west . 
If the [LOC UK] were to split , we would all become weakened . 
I agree , [MISC Scottish] independence is a matter for the [MISC Scots] , and should they vote for it , then that vote should be respected . 
But , personally , I believe rather than a breakup , the union should be reformed , so there is equality for all the nations . 
Bit of an off point - but I'll just say the 'West [MISC Lothian'] question and leave you with that . 
You argue that [PER David Cameron] should not be able to 'poke his big nose in' to the idea of [MISC Scottish] independence - yet , [MISC Scottish] MPs are able to do just that when certain [MISC English] affairs are debated in [LOC Westminster] ( something [MISC English] MPs are not able to do with [MISC Scottish] affairs ) . 
This is why there should be an appetite for reform within the Union - not a messy divorce that will leave us weakened , not strengthened . 
I don't agree that [MISC Scottish] should have a voice in [LOC Westminster] concerning England-only matters . 
Indeed , it would be far more pragmatic if we devolved the entire union -a parliament for every 5 or 10 million people in [LOC England] perhaps ? 
( [LOC North/Midlands/London/South] east/west ? ) 
I 'm sure there wouldn't be as much appetite for independence north of the border if the [MISC Scots] felt that they weren't subordinate to a parliament situated hundreds of miles away that doesn't really represent them ( [LOC Holyrood] is overwhelmingly full of centre-left MSPs , yet we effectively have a centre right majority government in [LOC Westminster] ) . 
I 'm not necessarily for or against independence . 
I haven't really read into it enough to decide . 
I fully support the decision to go independent though , if that is the outcome of the referendum , just as I would support the decision to remain in the union . 
I 'm not [MISC Polish] . 
That was my point . 
My grandfather settled in the [LOC Falkirk] area of [LOC Scotland] after the second world war ( having served alongside [MISC British] armed forces during the liberation of [LOC Europe] ) . 
I have [MISC Polish] ancestry , the same way [PER Cameron] has [MISC Scottish] ancestry . 
The idea that [PER Cameron] 's ancestry should entitle him to vote on matters concerning the [MISC Scottish] parliament is as ludicrous as my ancestry entitling me to vote in the [MISC Polish] Sejm . 
The argument that since [PER Cameron] is the prime minister of the [LOC UK] , he should have a voice is more legitimate , but it is not an argument I agree with . 
And if [LOC Brittany] wished to split , that is an issue for those living in [LOC Brittany] . 
If [PER Sarkozy] isn't from [LOC Brittany] , then his only job should be in ensuring that the split occurs legally . 
The argument that the whole of the [LOC UK] should vote on [LOC Scotland] 's independence is like saying the whole of the [ORG EU] should get to vote if the [LOC UK] ever holds an in/out Eu membership referendum . 
It 's completely absurd and there 's no justification for it . 
And what 's to say [LOC Scotland] will go bankrupt ? 
[LOC Iceland] , [LOC Norway] , [LOC Denmark] , [LOC Finland] , [LOC Austria] , [LOC Switzerland] , [LOC Lithuania] , [LOC Estonia] , [LOC Latvia] and [LOC Ireland] all have population sizes comparable to or smaller than [LOC Scotland] , and all function well as independent states . 
The [LOC Nordic countries] have some of the strongest economies in the world , as does [LOC Switzerland] . 
And the [MISC Irish] economy was , until recently , booming . 
[LOC Iceland] is a very interesting example . 
No major heavy industry , a population a little · over 1/3 of a million , universal healthcare and education ( free at university level at state universities ) and yet it manages to maintain one of the highest standards of living ( arguably the highest ) in the world . 
Claiming that [LOC Scotland] would go bankrupt in no time is ridiculous . 
It is entirely possible that [LOC Scotland] could follow the [MISC Nordic] example if it ever decides to vote for independence . 
People forget that [LOC Edinburgh] is a reasonably large financial centre ( relatively large for a country of 5 million ) and that central [LOC Scotland] was a cradle for the industrial revolution . 
Add to that revenue from hybrocarbon extractions in the north sea , fishing exports , and the ability to become reasonably self-sufficient in renewable energy ( wind , tidal , hydroelectric -there 's potential for it on [LOC Scotland] 's rugged landscape ) and I see no reason why [LOC Scotland] would be unable to function as an independent nation . 
Apologies for misunderstanding your nationality . 
I think the difference with [LOC Scotland] to those [MISC Nordic] economies is that [LOC Scotland] 's current expenditure is higher than it would be ovule were to split . 
It is enormously dependent on the support of the whole of the [LOC UK] . 
It would have to scrap free university fees , it wouldn't have the [ORG NHS] , thus [LOC UK] infrastructure employs many [MISC Scots] . 
If it wasn't to go bankrupt it would certainly struggle for decades . 
The [ORG EU] example just isn't the same at all . 
The [ORG EU] is not a country that actively supports each other economically ( other than bailouts ) as much as a country does , it isn't as socially connected , it employs an extremely small percentage of people , they aren't politically connected and have no national identity . 
[MISC You're] an idiot . 
Loads of " far right " parties advocate high taxes , why ? 
Because it 's based on jealousy . 
Poor white folks blame their own poverty on the rich . 
[PER Hitler] had an extensive welfare state , the [ORG BNP] would punish the bankers to the point of destroying what is quite possibly the only real money maker the [LOC UK] has . 
Lol banking is the only real money maker the [LOC UK] has.. . 
well firstly that isn't true and secondly they pay a pathetically small amount of taxes anyway so provide next to nothing to this country . 
They pay a small percent by the overage sum is huge . 
Where else does the money the government spend come from ? 
Do you really think that the [LOC West] would lose to a bunch of countries that hate their own neighbours ? 
[LOC India] and [LOC Pakistan] hate each other and then there is [LOC China] who hate both . 
The [LOC Middle East] would just be destroyed if it was a total war . 
If anything , the 'arrogance' would increase as a result . 
There is no way in hell that [ORG NATO] would lose to those countries . 
[LOC Pakistan] is no match for [LOC India] now . 
And in the future [LOC Pakistan] will be a mere annoyance than a real threat . 
[LOC China] and [LOC India] may have their differences , but they'll never go to war with each other . 
They both stand to lose too much in the process . 
[LOC China] is already wrapping a fist around the [LOC West] 's balls by buying up their debt and forcing the west to be economically dependent on them . 
Very smart those [MISC Chinese] . 
[LOC India] should eventually get in on the act , while weaning themselves off western investment , then when the time is right , they should use economic warfare to plunge western economies into chaos , crippling their financial power , and ultimately their military power . 
After a few months so the [LOC West] will be very vulnerable . 
We 've had to endure your cr*p for generations . 
We're a patient people . 
We don ; t have to rely on military power alone , and we can wait until the time is right . 
are you aware that the arabs and whites were rival powers until the white europeans overtook following the renaissance ? 
millions of white christians were enslaved by arabs . 
[LOC spain] , a white country was occupied by arabs for centuries . 
arabs conquered the old eastern roman empire , they attempted to invade [LOC europe] for centuries , finally being repelled at the battle of le panto . 
white people today and victims of massive levels of anti white violence all across the western world . 
[LOC america] especially . 
you are a racist . 
Oh , I feel so sorry for the poor white people , they 've had it sooooo bad . 
Who the hell are the blacks , who were enslaved by whites to complain ? 
Who the hell are the [MISC Indians] , who were enslaved and robbed blind by whites to complain ? 
They 've been sooo bad to the whites over the years , haven't they ? 
And it 's not like Blacks and [MISC Asians] ever suffer discrimination at the hands of whites , is it ? 
Poor whites . 
You have it so bad . 
Idiot . 
from all the other taxes businesses and people pay ? 
[ORG Barclays] paid £113m in corporation tax in 2009 if you combine it with all the other banks it doesn't even make £1billion so you are saying that in 2009 the only money the government made was £1billion ? 
This is what happens when you dont believe in equality or understand how countries make money . 
See people can learn to live with each other peacefully , not via segregation . 
Who is this 'we' ? 
[LOC Okay] , [LOC China] has the debt bought up , but if they were to be destroyed who would chase it up ? 
[LOC India] are no match for any [MISC Western] country , not even [LOC Belgium] . 
Are you going to send the slum kids to attack , or how about the frail women ? 
The [LOC West] has far more economic and military power than the [MISC East] , to suggest otherwise shows that you're delusional . 
1 ) Of course not , they haven't made them yet . 
So on what basis will you attack [LOC Iran] ? 
That they MAY acquire nuclear weapons . 
That is so ****ing silly . 
If the [LOC UK] were planning to abolish murder as a criminal charge in a few years time , could I go out and murder 100 people based on the intention , " Well , it 's going to be abolished anyway " . 
2 ) I beg to differ . 
It has repeatedly refused to declare several sites and when they were caught out they said they were going to declare them anyway . 
Evidence ? 
3 ) As I said before here you are , making a pipsqueak about it and you only have to have an open mind to know that [LOC America] 's being hypocritical . 
I Know [LOC America] AND [LOC ISRAEL] are being hypocritical . 
Yet no one is telling them that . 
First of all to put it into context [LOC Israel] didn't threaten [LOC Iran] . 
It 's been the warmongering on the mullahs' part after they decided they wanted [LOC Israel] destroyed for some obscure reason because their ideology advocated it . 
[LOC Iran] is not an [MISC Arab] country , the [MISC Israel-Arab] conflict has absolutely nothing to do with [LOC Iran] . 
The mullahs have no right funding proxies there because they are getting involved in something that has nothing to do with them . 
The mullahs themselves see the [MISC Arabs] as more of an enemy than [LOC Israel] so this comparison is idiotic as there will never , ever be unity in the [LOC Middle East] amongst Muslims and I hope there never is either . 
( 1 ) Yet for 30 years , they didn't do anything . 
In fact , [LOC Iran] has never even waged war against [LOC Iran] which cannot be said for it 's neighboring countries . 
A very optimistic view . 
[LOC China] and [LOC Russia] don't want the [LOC US] to throw its weight around so they're using their veto as a feeble show of strength . 
By vetoing the criticism of [PER Assad] 's actions they want to show that they will not just follow [LOC America] 's lead on this one . 
( 1 ) [LOC Feeble:] [LOC America] 's looking feeble . 
They can't intervene and save their beloved " democracies in action " because of [ORG Russia/China] . 
There used to be a time when [MISC Americans] would say " **** the world , we are doing this " . 
Defending itself against what ? 
[ORG Hezbollah] was created by [LOC Iran] and [PER Khomeini] decided to send Revolutionary Guards there to train militants as a 'resistance' group . 
They don't seem to be doing much resisting by constantly firing rockets into [LOC Israel] are they ? 
That 's a whole different argument and frankly , this has nothing to do with it . 
As I said before the mullahs have no right to poke their nose into the [MISC Arab-Israel] conflict so whether [ORG Hezbollah] attacked first or otherwise , it doesn't justify their actions . 
The [MISC Afghan] security force was created by the [LOC US] and the coalition . 
Yet when they attack the people who they are " helping " , they are labelled terrorists . 
On the same scale , [LOC America] has no RIGHT to poke it 's nose at the [MISC Arab/Israel] conflict if [LOC Iran] hasn't got the same right . 
Why are there different rules for one country and different rules for other countries ? 
Well it 's obvious they'll say that but it 's obvious they're after a bomb . 
It 's so they can throw their weight around without fear of reprisal from [LOC America] or [LOC Israel] , not for use . 
They shouldn't be allowed nukes , period . 
As for an invasion , definitely not . 
why is [LOC israel] allowed nukes though . 
Okay [LOC Iran] should not have Nuclear weapons but [LOC Israel] has no right to say it , 
Its like a thief telling other people not to thieve because its illegal 
The same way I saw the [LOC US] invading [LOC Pakistan] instead of [LOC Afghanistan] even though [LOC Pakistan] have nukes . 
Because [LOC Pakistan] largely follows [MISC American] orders . 
The [LOC US] assisted them in developing nukes in the first place . 
As I said before [LOC Iran] initiated it.. . 
How ? 
For example ? 
The Shah seemed pretty content with staying out of it . 
The Shah 's absolutism was a knock-on effect . 
[PER Mossadegh] was going forward with social-democratic nationalism that had been popularised by [PER Nasser] and [MISC Arab] leaders , and this led to the 1953 coup . 
Where did I say that ? 
Note it was a question . 
Why do you keep jumping to conclusions . 
How did me explaining the reason for [LOC China] and [LOC Russia] 's veto somehow make me an [MISC American] lover . 
Bishy said that 'we 'd see more positive results from [LOC China] and [MISC Russia'] and I implied that the [MISC Chinese] and [MISC Russians] hold no sympathy for the [MISC Syrian] people rather they want to maintain their control and not have the [LOC US] throw its weight around . 
The way OP is written makes it a good guess you 'd be backing [MISC US-Israel] because you seemed to be agreeing with the proposed intervention by them , but fair enough if you're not . 
Though based on what you're criticising [LOC Iran] for , it should be quite a bit down on your priority list . 
No . 
I was just mentioning the [LOC Iran] bit.. . 
Why does the [LOC US] and [LOC Israel] having favoured factions justify [LOC Iran] to do the same . 
It doesn't justify it , but it puts their actions into context . 
On the same logic , being hit by someone doesn't justify hitting them , but it makes why you do ( if you do ) understandable . 
UPDATING AN EMAIL LAW FROM THE PAST CENTURY 
[PER Steven Warshak] , a [LOC Cincinnati] businessman who built an empire selling male sexual enhancement drugs , was convicted of wire fraud several years ago , based in large part on his email correspondence , which authorities had extracted via a subpoena under a 1986 law governing electronic privacy . 
A federal appeals court in [LOC Ohio] later found , however , that the government had violated Warshak’s constitutional right to privacy . 
The court said investigators should have convinced a judge that there was probable cause and obtained a search warrant , as though his messages had been stashed in a desk drawer . 
Although the court let the conviction stand , the case highlighted the conflicting legal rules that govern electronic privacy . 
[ORG Congress] is now set to clarify those rules , bringing that quarter-century-old law , the [ORG Electronic Communications Privacy Act] , or [ORG ECPA] , in line with the [MISC Internet] age . 
On Thursday , the [ORG Senate Judiciary Committee] will start deliberating a measure that would require the government to get a search warrant , issued by a judge , to gain access to personal emails and all other electronic content held by a third-party service provider . 
The current statute requires a warrant for emails that are less than 6 months old , but it lets the authorities gain access to older communications – or bizarrely , emails that have already been opened – with just a subpoena and no judicial review . 
The law governs the privacy of practically everything entrusted to the [MISC Internet] – family photos stored with a Web service , journal entries kept online , company documents uploaded to the cloud , and the flurry of emails exchanged every day . 
The problem is that it was written when the cloud was just a cumulus in the sky . 
[LOC Silicon Valley] companies as well as advocacy groups from the political left and right have been lobbying for change for many years , and reform legislation seems to be gaining broad political support . 
Even the [ORG Justice Department] appears to have approved one major change: requiring law enforcement to get a search warrant for all kinds of electronic content , no matter how long it has been in electronic storage or what exactly electronic storage means . 
“Changing the law has become more of an imperative because of the growth of cloud computing , because everyone including members of [ORG Congress] are storing sensitive info with third-party providers and they want it to be protected , ” said [PER Greg Nojeim] , senior counsel at the [MISC Washington-based] [ORG Center for Democracy and Technology] , which is financed partly by [LOC Silicon Valley] companies and which is part of a coalition pushing for reform . 
“The technology is advancing and people realize the law has to keep pace.” 
Updating the bill could have a broader impact on civil cases as well , clarifying who can gain access to emails , photos and [ORG Facebook] posts in corporate litigation and divorce court . 
It could also lay out clearer rules for government agencies like the [ORG Internal Revenue Service] to follow to gain access to private citizens’ emails . 
The agency told [ORG Congress] recently that it seeks search warrants before reading taxpayer emails , though its written policy says otherwise , according to an information request filed by the [ORG American Civil Liberties Union] . 
Courts across the country , apparently baffled by how to apply the existing law , which applies to content held in “electronic storage , ” have ruled in sometimes contradictory ways over the privacy of electronic material in both civil and criminal cases . 
In one prominent case , [PER Lee Jennings] sued a relative of his wife who broke into his [ORG Yahoo] account and ferreted out emails describing an extramarital affair that were later used as incriminating evidence in divorce proceedings . 
[PER Jennings] claimed a violation of his privacy under the electronic privacy act , but the highest court in his home state of [LOC South Carolina] held that his emails , which sat on Yahoo’s servers , were not held in “electronic storage” and therefore were not covered by the statute . 
A federal court in [LOC California] years earlier had ruled differently in another case , interpreting “electronic storage” far more broadly . 
Jennings’ lawyer , [PER Neal K. Katyal] , a former acting solicitor general in the [LOC Obama] administration , asked the [ORG Supreme Court] to reconcile the dueling interpretations . 
The court declined to hear the case this month , effectively leaving it to [ORG Congress] to clarify the law . 
Although the appeals court ruling in the [LOC Warshak] criminal case is binding only in the 6th Circuit , it has since become the default legal threshold for many Web companies . 
[ORG Facebook] says it turns over content created by users – pictures , posts , messages – only after it is served with a search warrant , though a subpoena suffices for basic subscriber information , including a user’s name and email address . 
Twitter , too , says “requests for contents of communication require a [LOC U.S.] search warrant , ” and it informs users when it receives a request for information from a government agency . 
[ORG Microsoft] , which operates email and cloud storage services , follows a similar practice , insisting on a search warrant for “content , ” including documents , photos , email and instant messages . 
With a subpoena , the company can divulge a user’s [ORG Internet Protocol] record , though , which can be used to establish a person’s location . 
“The law is so old it doesn’t account for how we have turned into a digital society , ” said [PER Bryan Schilling] , a lawyer at [ORG Microsoft] . 
He offered an offline analogy: “If somebody had a storage unit , law enforcement would be required to get a search warrant , ” he said . 
“It’s the same thing now , as we store more and more of our content in the cloud , consumer or enterprise.” 
The original sponsor of the 1986 law , Sen. [PER Patrick Leahy] , [ORG D-Vt.] , has called its overhaul his top priority for the year . 
He and Sen. [PER Mike Lee] , [PER R-Utah] , have introduced a measure requiring law enforcement to obtain a warrant for all electronic content , including emails , regardless of how old they are . 
That overhaul is backed by an unlikely coalition . 
Amazon and [ORG Google] , which offer cloud-based services to consumers and businesses , are lobbying for the change , along with startups like [ORG Evernote] and [ORG Tumblr] , which operate modern-day private diaries . 
They have joined with advocacy groups as diverse as the [ORG American Civil Liberties Union] and [ORG Americans for Tax Reform] . 
The issue of email privacy received the greatest attention last year , when Gen. [PER David H. Petraeus] , the former director of the [ORG Central Intelligence Agency] , resigned after an inquiry into his email correspondence turned up evidence of an extramarital affair . 
He and his biographer , [PER Paula Broadwell] , had exchanged amorous correspondence in a “draft” folder of a shared [MISC Gmail] account , apparently to elude detection . 
Those draft messages , because they had not been transmitted across the [MISC Internet] , could have been viewed by federal authorities with nothing more than a subpoena , according to current law . 
[PER GEORGE JONES] IN REAL LIFE AND REAL TIME 
Early in 1977 , a couple of years after he and [PER Tammy Wynette] had divorced , the country music star [PER George Jones] played a show at the [LOC Stardust Inn] in [LOC Waldorf] , [LOC Md.] , his first in the [LOC Washington] area in several years . 
I was then a young pop music critic at [ORG The Washington Post] , so it fell to me to write a profile of the notoriously hard-drinking singer . 
What followed was an experience so intense , so remarkable for its raw emotional force , that I could not help but think of it Friday , when it was announced that [PER Jones] had died in a [LOC Nashville] , [LOC Tenn.] , hospital at the age of 81 . 
That weekend I learned two important things about Jones: that there was very little distance between him and his songs , and that the same qualities that made him a great artist also made his life a torment . 
In those days he was still unashamedly carrying a torch for [PER Wynette] , who had left him because , as she put it in legal papers she filed , he “drinks to such an extent that he becomes completely and absolutely unmanageable.” 
On stage that weekend , he reworked songs like “She Thinks I Still Care” and “Picture Me Without [MISC You”] so that they included references to her , making them almost embarrassingly personal , as if she were in the audience and he was singing only to her . 
But it was on his tour bus between sets that I saw [PER George Jones] more achingly and nakedly vulnerable than any performer I have ever encountered , before or since that night . 
He was dressed in a flashy leisure suit and wore a pair of glittering diamond rings on his left hand , including one with his initials , but as he talked about [PER Wynette] and how much he still loved her , he began to weep . 
I don’t think he was drunk . 
He talked about how he was trying to stay dry for [PER Tammy] , who by that time had already re-married and divorced again . 
Within a year or two , he would develop a cocaine habit that would send his career off the rails , but there was no sign of that either . 
This was just [PER George Jones] in real life and real time . 
It is hard today , in a time when irony has become a dominant cultural mode and artists are screened from reporters by phalanxes of handlers , to imagine so public a breakdown happening or a celebrity letting his pain be so visible . 
But [LOC Jones] wasn’t ashamed or embarrassed by that display , and when he went back to the stage for a second set of what he described to me as “sad , sloppy tear-jerkers , ” his singing was even more passionate and inspired , with his twangy , somewhat nasal voice cracking in all the right places with what had to be genuine feeling , not artifice . 
Over a career that lasted nearly 60 years , [PER Jones] recorded more than 100 albums , and over and over again , he didn’t just sing the songs that were given to him . 
In the best of his recordings , as on that night , he also inhabited them , so that anyone listening to him could be sure: He really means it , he has really lived this song about heartbreak or hangovers and knows what it means , poor soul . 
As someone who grew up in [LOC Chicago] listening mostly to the blues , I had no special fondness for country music , whose only local outlet in those days was the radio station [ORG WJJD] . 
But seeing [PER George Jones] live for the first time that cold night in southern [LOC Maryland] was a revelation , because in his own highly idiosyncratic way he showed himself to be no less soulful a singer than [PER Howlin’ Wolf] on something like “How Many More Years” or [PER Otis Redding] on “I’ve [MISC Been Loving You Too] [MISC Long.”] 
Despite all the drinking and drug binges that would dog his career , [PER Jones] never lost that gift . 
In 2009 , assigned to write a profile of the [MISC Canadian] singer-songwriter [PER Leonard Cohen] for this newspaper , I walked into [LOC Cohen’s] [LOC New York] hotel suite to find him playing one of [MISC Jones’] late-career gems , “Choices , ” on his iPod . 
[PER Cohen] expressed great admiration for [PER Jones] and then recited one of the song’s most powerful verses: 
I was tempted 
By an early age I found 
I liked drinkin’ 
Oh , and I never turned it down 
There were loved ones 
But I turned them all away 
Now I’m living and dying 
With the choices I made 
@In part because of his consistent “nipping , ” as he called it , [PER Jones] never enjoyed the crossover success of his contemporaries [PER Johnny Cash] and [PER Merle Haggard] , and so his passing will probably not have the broad cultural resonance that Cash’s did . 
But he was , hands down , a superior singer , a fact obvious to everyone in the country music field: As [PER Waylon Jennings] once sang , “If we all could sound like we wanted to , we’d all sound like [PER George Jones.”] 
But even within the confines of “pure country , ” whatever that term might mean today , [PER Jones] did not stand still . 
He began his career very much in the mold of his idol [PER Hank Williams] , singing tunes about honky-tonks and carousing . 
He never lost his affection for that genre , but over the years he also evolved into a master of ballad singing , especially on his duets with [PER Melba Montgomery] and [PER Wynette] , both before and after they were married . 
And though a brief late ‘50s flirtation with rockabilly didn’t pan out , [PER Jones] also knew how to rock . 
It’s almost forgotten now , but he and [PER Elvis Presley] once were co-headliners on a [LOC Louisiana] [MISC Hayride] tour , and generations of rock 'n’ roll bands , including ones I played in , have covered songs like “Why Baby Why , ” “White Lightning” and “The Race Is On” and found them to be guaranteed crowd-pleasers . 
Beginning in the 1980s , [PER Jones] , with the help of his fourth wife , [PER Nancy Sepulvedo] , pulled himself out of his tailspin . 
But by then the country music mainstream had begun to move on to more polished styles , and [PER Jones’] visceral approach fell out of fashion . 
In recent years , [PER Jones] had thought of himself as a relic , and expressed bitterness at what he saw as the disregard for what he represented . 
All that may be true , but it can’t – and doesn’t – dim the magnificence of his achievements , any more than his personal weaknesses and demons did . 
[ORG DEATH ROW] INMATE ’ S REQUEST FOR DNA TESTING IS REJECTED 
The state of [LOC Mississippi] rejected on Monday a request to submit physical evidence for DNA testing made by a prisoner scheduled to be put to death Tuesday evening . 
[PER Willie J. Manning] , convicted in 1994 of murdering two college students , had been repeatedly rebuffed in the courts as he sought to have DNA tests performed on certain crime scene evidence . 
But the most recent requests came about because of two letters sent by the [ORG Justice Department] in recent days to the prosecutor who handled [MISC Manning’s] trial . 
The letters concerned the trial testimony of an [ORG FBI] expert asked to examine “hair fragments” found at the scene of the murders . 
The expert testified that in this case he could determine only that the hairs came from an [MISC African-American] but that hair comparison analysis was capable , given better samples , of matching a hair to a particular individual . 
[PER Manning] is black ; the murder victims were white . 
The prosecutor cited this testimony several times in his closing arguments . 
In a letter dated May 2 , the [ORG Justice Department] said the expert’s testimony about the general capability of hair analysis – that it could match a hair to a specific individual – was erroneous and “exceeded the limits of the science.” 
Then , in a letter dated May 4 , the department further said that such analysis could not “determine” that a hair came from a person of a certain race , as the expert testified at one point , only that the hair “possesses certain traits that are associated with a particular racial group.” 
The [ORG FBI] offered in both letters to perform DNA testing on the hair fragments . 
Manning’s lawyers argued that these letters constituted new evidence and thus that the hairs , as well as other evidence collected at the scene including a rape kit and fingernail scrapings , should be submitted for [MISC DNA] testing before [PER Manning] is put to death . 
In the response denying the requests , the state attorney general , [PER Jim Hood] , called the new requests a “red herring , ” saying that the letters did not “represent new evidence , ” nor did they repudiate the testimony given by the [ORG FBI] expert in 1994 . 
Manning’s lawyers are still lobbying the governor for a stay of execution . 
On Friday , Manning’s brother and the [ORG Mississippi Innocence Project] filed suit to preserve all the physical evidence for DNA testing even if the execution is carried out . 
FOCUS TURNS TO THREE SUSPECTS IN [MISC BELGIAN] DIAMOND ROBBERY 
[LOC PARIS] – Investigators in three countries continued unraveling the plot behind a brazen $50 million diamond robbery in [LOC Belgium] , focusing Thursday on a [MISC Swiss] lawyer , a real estate businessman and a [MISC French] luxury car exporter with a prison record for fraud . 
After a series of raids Tuesday and Wednesday in [LOC Switzerland] , [LOC Belgium] and [LOC France] , the authorities started releasing some of the more than 30 men who were arrested and questioned in connection with the Feb. 18 robbery , in which armed men in police suits attacked a [MISC Zurich-bound] plane minutes before takeoff from the [LOC Brussels] airport . 
Investigators in [LOC Belgium] and [LOC Switzerland] suspect that a critical organizer in the plot was [PER Marc Bertoldi] , 43 , a [MISC French] car exporter whose listed address was in a wealthy seaside neighborhood of [LOC Antibes] on the [PER Cote] d’Azur and who owns a restaurant in [LOC Casablanca] , [LOC Morocco] . 
He was arrested Tuesday in [LOC France] and remains in prison , awaiting a hearing May 16 in [LOC Metz] for extradition to [LOC Belgium] . 
Investigators said Bertoldi’s arrival in [LOC Geneva] after the theft had provided a critical breakthrough in the inquiry . 
After Bertoldi’s arrest , the police trailed an unidentified [MISC Swiss] lawyer and a real estate owner Wednesday as they made an exchange of a key to a cellar where some of the stolen diamonds were discovered . 
Bertoldi’s lawyer , [PER Olivier Rondu] , said Thursday that his client denied the accusations against him and was willing to be extradited to [LOC Belgium] to confront the charges . 
“He has a surprising position that he wants to go to [LOC Belgium] as quickly as possible to explain himself , because he says he has done nothing , ” [PER Rondu] said . 
“He denies participating in the robbery at [LOC Brussels] airport.” 
[PER Rondu] also confirmed that his client had been convicted in the past for fraud and robbery and had served a prison term . 
In [LOC Switzerland] , where eight people were arrested Wednesday , the real estate owner and the [MISC Swiss] lawyer remained in detention . 
[PER Francois Canonica] , a lawyer for the [MISC Swiss] lawyer , also denied any wrongdoing on his client’s part , telling a [MISC Swiss] newspaper , [LOC Tribune de Geneve] , “My client has faith that ultimately he will be acquitted.” 
MILITANT SAYS HE IS BEHIND FATAL [LOC NIGER] ATTACK 
[LOC DAKAR] , [LOC Senegal] - [PER Mokhtar Belmokhtar] , the mastermind of the January seizure of an [MISC Algerian] gas plant that left dozens of foreign hostages dead , has claimed responsibility for another terrorist attack - the suicide bombings on Thursday in [LOC Niger] that killed about 30 people , including 24 soldiers and at least six jihadists . 
If true , Belmokhtar’s claim would put one of the [MISC Sahel’s] most hardened militants , whom [MISC Chad’s] military said in March it had killed in battle , back at the center of the region’s fight against [MISC Islamist] jihad . 
Experts saw no reason to doubt Belmokhtar’s claim , despite the unconfirmed claim by the [MISC Chadian] military , which said that [ORG Belmokhtar] had died in the [LOC Ifoghas] mountain range during the joint [MISC French-Chadian] campaign against [MISC Islamist] militants in northern [LOC Mali] . 
Neither [LOC France] nor [LOC Algeria] , where [PER Belmokhtar] has been a wanted man for years for his role in the 1990s civil war there , ever confirmed Chad’s assertion . 
No proof was presented of his death , and a fellow militant later denied it in an [MISC Internet] posting . 
The latest claim by Belmokhtar - a veteran of training by al-Qaida in [LOC Afghanistan] , years of terrorist acts against the [MISC Algerians] and multiple kidnappings of [MISC Westerners] in the [LOC Sahara] - came hours after bomb-laden vehicles ripped through a military installation and a [MISC French-owned] uranium mine in [LOC Niger] . 
[PER Belmokhtar] , who is considered perhaps the most redoubtable of the region’s surviving militants , also played a leading role in the [MISC Islamist] takeover of northern [LOC Mali] last year . 
The new claim was made on a number of different websites . 
In one , [PER Belmokhtar] himself , using his nom de guerre [PER Khalid Abu al-Abbas] , signed a claim on jihadist forums that fighters from his “Those Who Sign with [MISC Blood”] brigade - the same group that carried out the [LOC Algeria] attack - blew up the [MISC French] mine and the [LOC Niger] base , according to the [ORG SITE Monitoring Service] , which tracks extremists . 
The claim was posted by the same user who put out a video of [MISC Belmokhtar] in December , SITE said , and it asserted that the attacks were in retaliation for purported assertions by [LOC Niger] to have defeated the jihadists . 
“We warn all the countries that are intending to participate in the [MISC Crusader] campaign on our land , even if in the name of peacekeeping , that we will make you taste the heat of death and wounds in your homelands and among your soldiers , ” SITE quoted [PER Belmokhtar] as saying . 
[LOC BRITAIN] AND [LOC ECUADOR] MAY DISCUSS ASSANGE CASE 
[LOC LONDON] - The [MISC Ecuadorean] foreign minister is due to travel to [LOC London] this month and has offered to meet his [MISC British] counterpart to discuss the impasse over the [PER Julian Assange] case , officials from both countries said on Monday . 
Assange , the founder of the anti-secrecy group [ORG WikiLeaks] , has been holed up for nearly a year in the tiny [MISC Ecuadorean] Embassy here , stymying [MISC British] attempts to extradite him to [LOC Sweden] . 
The [MISC Swedish] authorities want to question Assange in connection with accusations that he sexually assaulted two women , but he has said he fears that the [MISC Swedes] will in turn send him to the [LOC United States] to answer questions about his role in helping disseminate classified government information via WikiLeaks . 
The development concerning [ORG Assange] came on the same day as the court-martial of [MISC Pfc.] [PER Bradley Manning] , the Army private accused of passing on sensitive diplomatic and military information , was scheduled to begin in [LOC Maryland] . 
[PER Manning] has pleaded guilty to 20 of the 22 charges against him , but he has not admitted to the most serious charge , aiding the enemy . 
[PER Manning] has said he gave the material to [PER WikiLeaks] , which then helped disseminate it . 
Assange has never acknowledged that [PER Manning] was his source . 
A spokesman for the [MISC Ecuadorean] government said last week that the foreign minister , [PER Ricardo Patino] , planned to travel to [LOC London] on June 16 , three days before Assange’s first anniversary in the embassy , and to meet with [PER Assange] . 
[ORG “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador] has informed [LOC U.K.] authorities that Mr. [PER Patino] will be in [LOC London] and has offered to meet with Foreign Secretary [PER William Hague] to discuss the case of [PER Julian Assange] , ” the spokesman said . 
A spokesman for the [MISC British] [ORG Foreign Office] said it was informed of [ORG Patino’s] trip on Friday and was “considering” his request for a meeting with [ORG Hague] . 
“U.K. government officials have been in regular contact with representatives of the [MISC Ecuadorean] government , both in [LOC London] and [LOC Quito] , about Mr. [PER Assange] , ” the [ORG Foreign Office] said in a statement . 
“We hope the visit will contribute to our joint commitment to finding a diplomatic solution to this issue.” 
Last week , [ORG Reuters] quoted [PER Patino] as saying his government was preparing a document in which it would argue that [LOC Britain] is legally obliged to give Assange permission to travel to [LOC South America] . 
SOUTH AFRICAN LEADER CITES 'PROGRESS' IN MANDELA'S CONDITION 
[LOC JOHANNESBURG] - After four days in the hospital battling a lung infection , former President [PER Nelson Mandela] of [LOC South Africa] “is responding better to treatment , ” President [PER Jacob Zuma] told [ORG Parliament] in [LOC Cape Town] on Wednesday . 
“We are very happy with the progress that he’s now making , following a difficult few days , ” [PER Zuma] said . 
It was the first report of an improvement in Mandela’s condition since he was admitted to a hospital in [LOC Pretoria] early Saturday after suffering a recurrence of a persistent lung ailment , a legacy of the tuberculosis he contracted during the 27 years he was imprisoned for opposing apartheid . 
His health has been frail lately , and this hospitalization was his fourth in the last seven months . 
Government officials in the last few days had been more downbeat , describing [MISC Mandela’s] condition as “serious but stable” with no improvement . 
[PER Mandela] , 94 , is being treated in an intensive care unit , where close family members have been visiting him regularly . 
Among them are his daughters , his former wife [PER Winnie Madikizela-Mandela] and his grandson [PER Mandla Mandela] . 
His current wife , [PER Graça Machel] , canceled a speech in [LOC London] to be by his side . 
[PER Mandla Mandela] , who is a traditional leader in the [LOC Eastern Cape] village where his grandfather was born , spoke to reporters outside [MISC Mandela’s] home . 
“My grandfather is the father of the nation , ” he said . 
“He’s embraced by the global community , and we appreciate the support that we’ve received.” 
As an underground leader of the banned [ORG African National Congress] , [PER Mandela] was convicted of treason 49 years ago Wednesday . 
He was sentenced to life in prison , but was released in 1990 as the government , under intense international pressure , began negotiating with [PER Mandela] and the [ORG ANC] . 
[PER Mandela] was elected as [MISC South Africa’s] first black president in 1994 and served one term . 
He retired from public life in 2004 , and has not been seen in public since 2010 , when [LOC South Africa] hosted the [MISC World Cup] . 
MILITANTS ATTACK U.N . 
COMPOUND IN [LOC SOMALIA] 
[LOC MOGADISHU] , [LOC Somalia] - Militants staged a deadly assault on a [ORG U.N.] compound here Wednesday , the latest in a series of attacks that have chipped away at the security gains the [MISC Somali] capital has experienced in recent years . 
The [MISC Shabab] , the fearsome [MISC Islamist] militant group that once controlled much of the capital , claimed responsibility for the attack , which government officials said left at least 15 people dead , including seven attackers . 
The assault began when [MISC Shabab] militants blew up a pickup truck rigged with explosives outside the compound , witnesses said . 
Militants armed with rifles and wearing explosive vests then stormed the facility on foot . 
[MISC Somali] and [ORG African Union] troops responded to the scene . 
The ensuing firefight lasted more than an hour , punctuated by a series of blasts . 
Somalia’s minister of interior and national security , [PER Abdikarim Hussein Guled] , told reporters that the dead included four foreigners , four [MISC Somalis] working for the [ORG United Nations] as security personnel , as well as the attackers . 
In a statement , [MISC Somalia’s] prime minister , [PER Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid] , condemned “the senseless and despicable attack on innocent [ORG U.N.] civilians.” 
[LOC Mogadishu] has experienced a period of relative calm since [ORG African Union] forces and the [MISC Somali] army pushed back the [MISC Shabab] , leading it to announce a hasty retreat from the city in 2011 . 
The militant group vowed to shift tactics more toward guerrilla assaults , assassinations and suicide bombings . 
Militants “are now in complete control of the entire compound and the battle is still ongoing , ” the [PER Shabab] said on its Twitter feed during the attack . 
“Inside the compound are several clueless foreigners who were lulled into a false sense of security by a strong disinformation campaign ! ” 
The [PER Shabab] , who have sworn allegiance to al-Qaida , said that the group’s [ORG Martyrdom Brigade] had carried out the attack . 
The [ORG U.N.] compound sits on a busy stretch of road near the airport . 
An ambulance worker , [PER Abdirisak Moumin] , said that he had collected 13 wounded civilians , six of whom died from their injuries . 
[PER Nicholas Kay] , the [ORG U.N.] special representative for [LOC Somalia] , was outside the compound at a meeting nearby when the attack occurred . 
He called the attack an act of terrorism intended to derail Somalia’s drive toward recovery after decades of war and instability . 
While the [ORG United Nations] would review its security procedures , “the [ORG U.N.] is committed to its mission , ” [PER Kay] said in a telephone interview . 
“We’re here to help and we’re here to stay.” 
VIGIL FOR MANDELA CONTINUES AS FAMILY MEMBERS HOLD EMERGENCY MEETING 
[LOC JOHANNESBURG] - Singing crowds gathered outside the hospital where [PER Nelson Mandela] , [LOC South Africa’s] former president , lay in a critical state for a third consecutive day Tuesday , as family members held an emergency meeting at his ancestral village . 
Mandela’s eldest daughter , [PER Makaziwe] , at least two grandchildren and clan elders gathered at Mandela’s retirement house in [LOC Qunu] , the remote southern village where he grew up , according to news media reports . 
The subject of the meeting was not publicly disclosed , but [PER Naplisi Mandela] , an elder of the [PER Mandela] family , told the [MISC South] [ORG African Press Association] that they had gathered to discuss “delicate matters” - a euphemism widely interpreted to mean preparations for [MISC Mandela’s] death . 
Meanwhile , in [LOC Pretoria] , doctors continued to treat [PER Mandela] for a lung ailment that he contracted on [LOC Robben Island] , the notorious apartheid-era prison where he spent much of his 27 years behind bars until his release in 1990 . 
He was hospitalized June 8 , his fourth hospitalization since late last year . 
In a statement , President [PER Jacob Zuma] said [ORG Mandela’s] condition was unchanged . 
On Sunday , he visited [PER Mandela] and pronounced that his state had deteriorated from stable to critical . 
Noting that [PER Mandela’s] 95th birthday is on July 18 , [PER Zuma] urged [MISC South Africans] to celebrate his achievements . 
Still , after 18 days of anxious vigil , many appeared to be steeling themselves for the worst . 
Larger-than-usual crowds gathered at the gates of the [LOC Mediclinic Heart Hospital] to pay tribute to [PER Mandela] , as people dropped off cards at a growing shrine and sang songs . 
“There is no one like you , [PER Nelson Mandela] , ” one group sang in the [MISC Sotho] language . 
The emotional scenes were part of a perceptible shift in the national mood . 
Until recently , many [MISC South Africans] had avoided talking about [MISC Mandela’s] fate , calling it culturally inappropriate to speculate about any ailing figure , much less one as revered as [PER Mandela] , who played a central role in [MISC South Africa’s] transition from white-led minority rule to historic multirace elections in 1994 . 
But now many are openly talking about the prospect of bidding him farewell . 
Mandela’s declining condition came as President [PER Barack Obama] prepared to arrive in [LOC South Africa] on Friday on the second leg of an [MISC African] tour that will also take him to [LOC Tanzania] and [LOC Senegal] . 
But the [MISC South African] government said a planned meeting between [LOC Obama] and [LOC Mandela] - both the first black leaders of their countries - now looked unlikely . 
[MISC AFGHAN] COURT REVERSES CONVICTION IN TORTURE OF YOUNG WOMAN 
[LOC KABUL] , [LOC Afghanistan] - A court has reversed the convictions of three [MISC Afghans] jailed for torturing a young relative who had refused to become a prostitute , alarming activists who had celebrated the guilty verdicts as a warning to all those who would seek to reverse the strides made by women here in the past 12 years . 
A family had bought the young woman , [PER Sahar Gul] , from her stepbrother for $5,000 and had forced her to marry in 2011 , when she was just 13 or 14 . 
When she refused to consummate the marriage , her in-laws locked her in a basement , where they burned her with hot wires , pulled out her fingernails and twisted her skin with pliers for months . 
She was discovered in December 2011 curled up in a dank and dark corner of the cellar and badly malnourished . 
[PER Gul] now lives in a shelter in [LOC Kabul] . 
Her case attracted widespread attention in [LOC Afghanistan] and abroad . 
Three of her in-laws were convicted last year of attempted murder , and each was sentenced to 10 years in prison . 
The convictions were upheld on appeal , although her husband , who is in his 30s , remains at large . 
Last month , however , in a decision that received little publicity , the [ORG Supreme Court] sent the case back to the appeals court , saying that the violence appeared to warrant convictions for assault , not attempted murder , according to lawyers for the defendants . 
The appeals court agreed , voiding the convictions and ordering that the defendants - Gul’s mother-in-law , sister-in-law and father-in-law - be set free . 
The two women were released this week after about a year in prison , the lawyers said . 
They were not sure whether the father-in-law was yet out of prison . 
As word spread in [LOC Kabul] on Wednesday , [MISC Western] officials said they were still gathering details but would probably have a response in the coming days . 
[MISC Afghan] women’s rights activists reacted with alarm and said they would press to have the three defendants retried . 
“There’s smoke coming out of my hair . 
I am so angry , ” said [PER Manizha Naderi] , the executive director of Women for [MISC Afghan] Women . 
“This poor girl was in the basement for months . 
If she wasn’t rescued , she would be dead . 
She was starved and burned and had her fingernails pulled out . 
How is this not attempted murder ? ” 
The courts’ decisions make “a statement that violence against women is not that important , that [LOC Afghanistan] is becoming more conservative , ” [PER Naderi] added . 
[PER MICHAEL MASTROMARINO] , DENTIST GUILTY IN ORGAN SCHEME , DIES AT 49 
[PER Michael Mastromarino] , a former dental surgeon who became a tabloid sensation when he was charged with running a $4.6 million enterprise that plundered tissue and bone from corpses at funeral homes and sold them for transplants and research , died on Sunday at [LOC St.] [LOC Luke’s Cornwall Hospital] in [LOC Newburgh] , [LOC N.Y.] He was 49 and still serving a prison term . 
The cause was complications of metastatic liver cancer , [PER Mario Gallucci] , Mastromarino’s lawyer , said . 
The technology that allows the transplantation of critical organs also enables the far more common transplantation of tissue: bone can be used to repair fractures , veins for heart bypass surgery , and tendons and ligaments can restore mobility . 
Harvesting organs is allowed in [LOC New York] state , provided the donor does not carry a potentially communicable disease , the survivors approve and the person is not too old . 
But there are nowhere near enough willing donors to meet the demand for tissue , so the profit from one body can reach six figures . 
Mastromarino became licensed by [LOC New York] state to supply tissue banks and manufacturers of biological surgical instruments after his dental license was suspended in 2002 because of a drug addiction . 
He established a network of undertakers , whom he paid up to $1,000 per corpse , and soon took on assistants and formed a business based in [LOC New Jersey] , [ORG Biomedical Tissue Services] . 
He reportedly made $10,000 to $15,000 per body . 
But Mastromarino harvested organs and tissue from bodies without consent from the survivors , the authorities said , and removed material from people with cancer , [MISC HIV] and other diseases . 
He then forged paperwork , including consent forms and death certificates , to make the cause of death and age acceptable . 
The police began investigating irregularities at the [PER Daniel George] & [LOC Son Funeral Home] in [LOC Bensonhurst] , [LOC Brooklyn] , in 2005 . 
News reports included lurid details , like what the police called a secret room in the funeral home equipped with specialized surgical equipment ; leg bones replaced by PVC pipe so bodies would appear intact at viewings ( this procedure is common in lawful bone removal ) ; and the fact that one of the victims was [PER Alistair Cooke] , the [MISC British] journalist and former host of “Masterpiece Theater , ” whose arm and leg bones were taken even though he had had cancer . 
Mastromarino was charged in 2006 , along with two of his workers and an embalmer . 
He pleaded guilty in 2008 to numerous charges of enterprise corruption , reckless endangerment and body stealing and was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison . 
He and his wife , [PER Barbara] , agreed to pay $4.6 million to the district attorney’s office , to be distributed among the victims’ relatives . 
[PER Michael Mastromarino] was born in [LOC Brooklyn] on Sept. 16 , 1963 . 
He graduated from the [ORG University of Pittsburgh] and the [ORG New York] [LOC University College of Dentistry] . 
Mastromarino had surgical offices in [LOC New Jersey] and [LOC Manhattan] . 
He was a co-author , with [PER Michael R. Wiland] , of the book “Smile: [ORG How Dental Implants Can Transform Your Life.”] 
[PER Mastromarino] , who was divorced , is survived by two sons , [PER Michael] and [PER Jerry] . 
As for [PER Cooke] , his daughter , [PER Susan Cooke Kittredge] , said in an article in [LOC New York] magazine that “he would have been just horrified” by the illegal harvesting . 
But , she said , “at the same time , he would have appreciated the [MISC Dickensian] nature of it.” 
EXTRADITED COLOMBIAN TO FACE CHARGES OF DRUG TRAFFICKING 
A [MISC Colombian] who has been described by his country’s president as “the last of the great kingpins” was extradited to the [LOC United States] from [LOC Colombia] on Tuesday to face charges that he manufactured large quantities of cocaine that he then trafficked to the [LOC U.S.] and elsewhere . 
[PER Daniel Barrera] is to be arraigned Wednesday and Thursday in [LOC U.S.] district courts in [LOC Manhattan] and [LOC Brooklyn] , where he faces separate indictments . 
After those prosecutions , he will be arraigned in [LOC Miami] on additional charges , the authorities said . 
[PER Barrera] , also known as [PER El Loco] , was arrested in September in [LOC Venezuela] as a result of a complex operation that included [MISC Colombian] and [MISC Venezuelan] authorities , the [ORG CIA] , the [ORG Drug Enforcement Administration] and the [MISC British] intelligence . 
He was later sent to [LOC Colombia] , and his extradition was announced by the [LOC U.S.] attorneys in the three jurisdictions and other officials , including [PER Raymond W. Kelly] , the police commissioner of [LOC New York] ; and [PER Michele M. Leonhart] , the head of the [ORG DEA] . 
An indictment in [LOC Manhattan] says that [PER Barrera] relied on two [MISC Colombian] terrorist organizations to carry out his operations , buying raw cocaine paste from members of the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] , or [ORG FARC] , and processing it in laboratories in areas controlled by another group , to which he paid fees . 
Barrera’s organization produced upward of 400 tons of cocaine a year , “enriching itself and the two terrorist organizations it paid off , ” said [PER Preet Bharara] , the [LOC U.S.] attorney in [LOC Manhattan] . 
[PER Loretta E. Lynch] , the [LOC U.S.] attorney in [LOC Brooklyn] , said Barrera’s organization was “marked by its worldwide reach , ruthless criminality and staggering profits.” 
[PER Barrera] is charged in [LOC Manhattan] with one count of narcotics importation conspiracy , which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison . 
He faces a money laundering conspiracy charge in [LOC Brooklyn] . 
His lawyer declined to comment . 
Officials have said that [PER Barrera] , while residing in [LOC Venezuela] , changed his appearance through plastic surgery , slept in different places and burned his fingertips to try to make it impossible to identify him . 
[LOC EGYPT] CALLS FOR NEW LOOK AT MORSI PRISON ESCAPE 
[LOC CAIRO] - Egypt’s new rulers gave new credence to a court case against the ousted president , [PER Mohammed Morsi] , and members of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood] on Thursday over their escape from prison during the uprising that toppled his predecessor , [PER Hosni Mubarak] . 
The case was transferred from an appeals court to the [ORG State Security] prosecutor for further investigation . 
No charges have been filed as yet . 
Its acceptance by powerful prosecutors follows the arrest of many [ORG Muslim Brotherhood] members and is a new blow to the group by the military-backed government . 
The detentions have been criticized by rights groups and the [LOC Obama] administration , which spent Thursday walking back remarks made early in the day by a [ORG State Department] spokeswoman , [PER Jen Psaki] , seeming to criticize [PER Morsi] as undemocratic and in so doing seeming to validate the military’s move to oust him . 
At her regular [ORG State Department] briefing Thursday , asked about the reactions , [PER Psaki] said she had been “referring to all of the voices that have been - we have heard coming - the millions , I should say , coming from [LOC Egypt] , and how strongly they have voiced their views about his rule . 
But beyond that is up for the [MISC Egyptian] people to determine.” 
The renewed investigation of [PER Morsi] and members of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood] dates to the uprising that led to the ouster of [PER Mubarak] in 2011 . 
[PER Morsi] and other Brotherhood leaders were arrested Jan. 28 and held in the [LOC Wadi] [MISC Natroun] prison north of [LOC Cairo] , until they escaped two days later . 
The case languished after [PER Morsi] was elected last year in the country’s first free presidential race , although local news outlets and [MISC Morsi’s] opponents accused militants from [ORG Hamas] , the [MISC Brotherhood’s Palestinian] offshoot , of freeing their colleagues . 
[PER Morsi] has not been seen publicly since his ouster July 3 . 
It is unclear where he is being held , or whether he and the others will face the charges in court . 
The ouster of [PER Morsi] and the subsequent suppression of the Brotherhood has enraged the group’s members and led to a spate of scapegoating attacks by [MISC Muslim] extremists against [MISC Christians] they accuse of supporting his fall , rights activists said . 
While tensions between the [MISC Christian] minority and extremist elements in the [MISC Muslim] majority are not new , attacks have been reported across the country - in the northern [ORG Sinai Peninsula] , in a resort town on the [ORG Mediterranean Coast] , in [LOC Port Said] along the [LOC Suez Canal] and in isolated villages in upper [LOC Egypt] . 
No special session , but protesters leave [LOC Capitol] 
[ORG Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau] 
[LOC TALLAHASSEE] — They weren’t able to persuade Gov. [PER Rick Scott] to call a special session on the controversial ' 's tand your ground’' law . 
But the student activists known as the [ORG Dream Defenders] drew national attention to their cause by holding the longest sit-in demonstration at the [LOC Florida Capitol] in recent memory . 
On Thursday , the [MISC Miami-based] group announced that their record-setting protest is over — for now , at least . 
" After 31 days and 30 nights , we are leaving the [LOC Capitol] for our next phase , " [ORG Dream Defenders] executive director [PER Phillip Agnew] said . 
[PER Agnew] said the group would register thousands of new voters in the coming months and return to the Capitol for legislative committee hearings in the fall . 
The [ORG Dream Defenders’] occupation of the [LOC Capitol] began July 16 , three days after [PER George Zimmerman] was acquitted in the shooting death of [PER Trayvon Martin] , an unarmed teenager from [LOC Miami-Dade] . 
They promised to stay until [PER Scott] convened a special session on ' 's tand your ground’' and several other criminal justice issues . 
" We said if ( [PER Scott] ) would not give us a seat at the table , we would sleep on the floor until ( he ) gave us what we deserved , " [PER Agnew] said . 
[PER Scott] met with the protesters July 18 but refused their demands . 
The [ORG Dream Defenders] tried to persuade state lawmakers to call the session themselves , but they couldn’t muster the 96 votes needed . 
As of Thursday , 42 lawmakers had voted in favor of holding the session , 90 voted against , and 28 had yet to vote . 
This week , House Speaker [PER Will Weatherford] called for the group’s departure . 
The [ORG Dream Defenders] claimed several victories , including a promise from [LOC Weatherford] to hold a hearing on the ' 's tand your ground’' law this fall . 
The group also secured meetings with the [ORG Florida Department of Law Enforcement] to discuss racial profiling , [PER Agnew] said , and began a dialogue with the [ORG state Department of Juvenile Justice] on the disproportionate number of young [MISC African-American] men in prison . 
[PER Agnew] said the [ORG Dream Defenders] had not been pressured to wrap up their protest by the governor’s office or state law enforcement officials . 
The [ORG Capitol Police] who had watched over the group , [PER Agnew] added , ' 'd eserved a raise . " 
The state spent a total of $153,630 on police overtime throughout the protest , according to [ORG FDLE] . 
The [ORG Dream Defenders] didn’t anticipate their stay would last a month or that singer [PER Harry Belafonte] , rapper [PER Talib Kweli] or civil rights leaders [PER Jesse Jackson] and [PER Julian Bond] would join them in the [LOC Capitol] . 
" Gov. [PER Scott] , through his inaction , created a new group of leaders who will have a lasting effect on [LOC Florida] , " said state Rep. [PER Alan Williams] , a [LOC Tallahassee] [MISC Democrat] who mentored the group . 
When they packed up their belongings and left the [LOC Capitol] Thursday evening , the young activists wondered aloud if there had been some level of divine intervention along the way . 
On Wednesday , the state [ORG Department of Management Services] announced plans to test the fire alarm system in the [LOC Capitol] . 
The testing would last from 8 p.m. until midnight , and involve an " incredibly loud , high-pitch noise , " according to a press release . 
But before the testing began , the building adjacent to the [LOC Capitol] was struck by lightning . 
The [ORG Department of Management Services] decided to perform maintenance on that building’s fire alarm system instead . 
" I don’t know how to explain it , " [ORG Dream Defender] [PER Steven Pargett] said . 
" Some things are just meant to happen . " 
Times/Herald staff writers [PER Tia Mitchell] and [PER Michael Van Sickler] contributed to this report . 
A PINK-SLIP THANKS FOR A MAJOR DECISION 
On Baseball ) ; 
When [PER John Gaherin] , the chief labor negotiator for [MISC Major League Baseball] , arrived for a meeting with the chief of the players union and baseball’s arbitrator , he carried an envelope in the pocket of his suit jacket . 
It was two days before Christmas 1975 , not a time to be conducting serious business , but [PER Gaherin] and [PER Marvin Miller] , the executive director of the union , knew why [PER Peter Seitz] , the arbitrator , had summoned them . 
They knew that the subject of the meeting would be as serious a bit of business as baseball had ever experienced , and [PER Gaherin] went to the meeting prepared . 
[PER Seitz] had informally telegraphed his decision in a grievance case , and now he would formally hand his written opinion to the two men . 
As soon as he did , [PER Gaherin] handed [PER Seitz] the envelope . 
“You’re fired , ” it said in effect . 
Such is the perilous life of impartial arbitrators in baseball and other professional sports . 
Either side - the league or the union - has the right to fire them . 
Like managers , they are hired to be fired . 
“He told me he had expected as much , ” [PER Michael Seitz] , Peter’s son , said in a recent telephone interview . 
“His feeling was there was no other way to decide the case , because the baseball owners had been stupid in assuming that when they didn’t have a player under contract , they still had a contractual hold on him.” 
[PER Fredric R. Horowitz] , a 64-year-old lawyer from [LOC Santa Monica] , [LOC Calif.] , is the latest to take a turn . 
He will arbitrate [PER Alex Rodriguez’s] appeal of his 211-game suspension . 
While arbitrators pay for their decisions , which anger either the owners or the players , they don’t always receive credit for the significance of their decisions . 
[PER Seitz] , for example , was responsible for creating free agency in baseball with his decision in the 1975 [PER Andy Messersmith-Dave McNally] grievance , but I believe , as [PER Marvin Miller] used to complain , that some reports in the news media , including in [ORG The New York Times] , mistakenly credited other cases: [PER Curt Flood’s] 1970 lawsuit against baseball and [PER Catfish Hunter’s] 1974 grievance against [PER Charlie Finley] . 
Flood’s suit challenged the game’s reserve clause , the rule that bound a player to his team until he was traded , sold or released . 
Hunter’s grievance contended that [PER Finley] , the [LOC Oakland] [MISC Athletics’] owner , had breached his contract . 
The Hunter case was exactly what the union argued , a breach-of-contract case . 
[PER Finley] had not paid the premium on Hunter’s annuity , as stipulated in his contract , [PER Richard Moss] , the union lawyer , said , and the pitcher should be a free agent as a result . 
[PER Seitz] , in his first year as baseball’s arbitrator , agreed with [MISC Moss’] argument and declared Hunter a free agent . 
A year later , when [PER Seitz] ruled in the [MISC Messersmith-McNally] grievance , he did not cite the Hunter decision as a basis for this decision . 
As a breach-of-contract case , it affected no player but Hunter . 
No other player could gain free agency based on Seitz’s decision on Hunter . 
“It didn’t change the mind of a single owner , ” [PER Miller] said of the Hunter decision in one of the many conversations we had on the subject . 
" The owners’ position on free agency was the same after the Hunter case as it was before . " 
Nor , [PER Miller] added , did the [PER Flood] case affect the owners’ thinking on the reserve clause and free agency . 
The reserve clause had forever been the tie that bound players to their teams , whether they liked it or not . 
[PER Flood] did not like it , and when the [ORG St. Louis Cardinals] traded him to [LOC Philadelphia] , he opted to sue the commissioner rather than go to the [ORG Phillies] , contending that he should have the right to play where he wanted . 
The suit went all the way to the [ORG U.S. Supreme Court] , where [PER Flood] lost . 
The owners always argued that elimination of the reserve clause would ruin baseball , [PER Miller] said , and Flood’s loss in the lawsuit emboldened them to maintain their position . 
As heroic as [PER Flood] was in pursuing his lawsuit , it fell well short of having an effect . 
Its failure was one of the reasons the owners were so confident of winning the [MISC Messersmith-McNally] grievance in court when they appealed [ORG Seitz’s] decision , which said players could be free agents if they played the renewal year in their contract without signing a new contract . 
What the owners failed to understand , in their inexperience in labor matters , was that judges rarely overruled an arbitrator’s decision , doing so only if an arbitrator’s authority had been exceeded . 
The clubs and the commissioner have not done particularly well before arbitrators in instances where players have been suspended for conduct off the field . 
That history continued last year when [PER Shyam Das] overturned [PER Ryan Braun’s] 50-game suspension . 
[PER Das] was fired after his [PER Braun] ruling . 
Baseball would have preferred settling all of the doping cases stemming from the investigation into [PER Biogenesis] , an anti-aging clinic that is believed to have distributed banned substances to baseball players . 
The union also seemed eager to settle . 
But [PER Rodriguez] has appealed his 211-game suspension . 
Given the volatility of the [PER Rodriguez] case , it would not be surprising if Horowitz’s first major case were his last . 
FORMER JPMORGAN EMPLOYEE SURRENDERS IN 'LONDON WHALE' CASE 
Weeks after the [LOC U.S.] government charged [PER Javier Martin-Artajo] , a former [ORG JPMorgan Chase] employee , with hiding trading losses that ultimately reached more than $6 billion , he had his first day in court Tuesday as he surrendered to [MISC Spanish] authorities and kicked off what could be a lengthy extradition process . 
Martin-Artajo , a [MISC Spaniard] who worked in the bank’s [LOC London] office , was released soon after his surrender and arrest . 
He agreed to remain at the disposal of the [MISC Spanish] judiciary , but it was unclear whether his passport was confiscated to prevent him from leaving the country , according to a person briefed on the matter . 
The criminal charges stem from a risky bet at [LOC JPMorgan’s] chief investment office in [LOC London] , where [PER Martin-Artajo] worked . 
The bet involved so-called credit derivatives , which allow traders to bet on the perceived health of companies like [ORG American Airlines] . 
When the bet soured in the spring of 2012 , prosecutors claim , [PER Martin-Artajo] and [PER Julien Grout] , a lower-ranking employee , deliberately overstated the value of their positions to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in losses . 
The two were charged with wire fraud , falsifying bank records and contributing to false regulatory filings . 
Prosecutors also charged them with conspiracy to commit those crimes . 
The arrest in [LOC Spain] , the latest development in an episode that left a rare stain on [MISC JPMorgan’s] once-stellar reputation , underscores the challenge [LOC U.S.] authorities face in their pursuit of the traders . 
After announcing charges this month against [PER Martin-Artajo] and [PER Grout] , federal prosecutors and the [ORG FBI] in [LOC Manhattan] have encountered logistical hurdles . 
[MISC British] police issued an arrest warrant for [PER Martin-Artajo] at the behest of authorities in [LOC New York] , and then visited his house in [LOC London] only to find that he was gone . 
According to his lawyers , [PER Martin-Artajo] left [LOC London] “on a long-planned vacation” to his native [LOC Spain] without knowing of the pending charges . 
[PER Grout] , for his part , left [LOC London] this year for his native [LOC France] , which typically does not extradite its citizens . 
His lawyer , [PER Edward Little] , explained that his client also spent a brief period in the [LOC U.S.] , where his wife’s family lives . 
According to a person close to the case , both of the former traders have indicated through their lawyers that they are open to extradition but only if prosecutors recommend bail . 
Prosecutors have not charged a third trader , nicknamed “the [LOC London] [PER Whale.”] 
That trader , [PER Bruno Iksil] , has reached a deal with the authorities in [LOC Manhattan] that will spare him charges as long as he cooperates against his two former colleagues . 
LEADER OF FAR-RIGHT PARTY IN [LOC GREECE] IS JAILED 
[LOC ATHENS] , [LOC Greece] - The leader of the extreme-right [ORG Golden Dawn] party was returned to custody Thursday after appearing before a [MISC Greek] magistrate on charges of setting up a criminal organization , part of the government’s crackdown on a party described by [MISC Greek] and [MISC European] authorities as neo-Nazi and violent . 
The magistrate’s order to remand [PER Nikos Michaloliakos] , the first political party leader to face jail since Greece’s seven-year military dictatorship ended in 1974 , came a day after three of his fellow lawmakers facing similar charges were released from custody and told not to leave the country , and a fourth was ordered held pending trial . 
During more than six hours of testimony in an [LOC Athens] courtroom , [PER Michaloliakos] condemned the murder last month of a 34-year-old hip-hop artist and anti-fascist , [PER Pavlos Fyssas] , by a self-professed supporter of [ORG Golden Dawn] , and said he did not know whether members of the party were involved in violence , according to a court official . 
“I condemn the murder , like I condemn violence in general , ” he was quoted as saying . 
“I am not a [MISC Nazi.”] 
Leaving court early Thursday , [PER Michaloliakos] was defiant . 
“Long live [ORG Golden Dawn] ! 
Victory ! ” he declared as his wife , [PER Eleni Zaroulia] , another [MISC Golden Dawn] member of Parliament , cried , “You’re a diamond ! ” and his daughter , [PER Ourania Michaloliakou] , urged him , “Don’t buckle , don’t give in ! ” 
[PER Michaloliakos] was transferred to the capital’s high-security [LOC Korydallos] prison later in the day along with [PER Yiannis Lagos] , another [ORG Golden Dawn] lawmaker . 
[PER Giorgos Patelis] , the head of the party’s chapter in [LOC Nikaia] , near the spot where [PER Fyssas] was fatally stabbed , and an officer from the regional police precinct accused of supplying [MISC Golden Dawn] with information were taken to two other jails in central [LOC Greece] , state television reported . 
According to the police , [LOC Lagos] telephoned [PER Michaloliakos] half an hour after the killing of [PER Fyssas] on Sept. 18 . 
The lawmaker has been tied to protection and prostitution rackets as well as blackmail and money laundering , according to secret service documents leaked to the [MISC Greek] media this week . 
Later Thursday , a sixth lawmaker , [PER Christos Pappas] , the party’s second in command , was also ordered returned to custody after testifying for at least six hours before a magistrate . 
He was to stay overnight at the [LOC Athens] police headquarters before his transfer to prison . 
Arriving at the capital’s court complex , [PER Pappas] told reporters , “Golden [PER Dawn] will run in the next elections , whenever they may be.” 
PROTESTS [LOC AS CITY] COLLEGE CLOSES A STUDENT CENTER 
[PER Julie Turkewitz] contributed reporting . 
[LOC NEW YORK] - It was just a small room , one of hundreds in [LOC City] [MISC College’s] [LOC North Academic Center] , but over the years the [PER Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur] Student and [ORG Community Center] had taken on a significance beyond its square footage . 
To student organizers who used it as their meeting space , it was a place for lesbian and gay activists , women’s rights groups , community organizations and others to make common cause . 
To outside critics it was a symbol of campus politics gone berserk , its unofficial name a glorification of [ORG City College] alumni who had joined revolutionary organizations and gone on the lam . 
But officials at [ORG City College] , part of [LOC the] [ORG City University of New York] , insisted that charged history was not a factor when they decided that the room would be better used as an annex for the school’s career services office , two floors below . 
Without notice , security officers entered the room this past weekend , boxed up and removed its contents - and just to be on the safe side , locked down the entire building , including the library . 
With just a day to go before midterm exams , the library was reopened after a few hours . 
But Room 3/201 was not , resulting at least for a brief while in the incongruous sight of closed doors emblazoned with a bold , black fist , below a crisp white sign that read Careers and Professional Development . 
( The door had been repainted , without the fist , as of Monday afternoon . ) 
Given the center’s history , it could not have come entirely as a surprise when its former occupants let their dissatisfaction be known . 
They organized protest rallies , distributed fliers , posted videos and demanded [LOC that] [ORG City College] be shut down . 
A protester was arrested . 
And just in time for an outdoor demonstration on Monday , someone set off a fire alarm , sending hundreds of people out onto the plaza . 
“I think that the [ORG CUNY] administration is really scared of a lot of the organizing and community-building coming out of the building , ” said [PER Alyssia Osorio] , director of the [ORG Morales/Shakur Center] . 
“We provide so many services for the community - know-your-rights training , a farm share that provides healthy food , we’ve run a soup kitchen , we have provided baby-sitting services for people in the community.” 
[PER Deidra Hill] , vice president of communications at [ORG City College] , called the administration’s takeover of the room a matter of space . 
She said the career services office needed a quiet area where students can “meet with outside employers , with alumni , to seek advice on careers.” 
[ORG City College] said the unusually swift action was necessary . 
“We were concerned that we might have to move people , and that would not have been safe , ” [PER Hill] said . 
As for the protests , “Students were exercising their free speech rights , which the college supports , ” she said . 
[LOC The] [ORG City College] students whom the center’s name honors have never visited . 
[PER Guillermo Morales] , a leader of the [LOC FALN] , a [MISC Puerto Rican] independence group that claimed responsibility for a deadly bombing in [LOC New York] , fled to [LOC Cuba] . 
So did [PER Shakur] , who as a member of the [ORG Black Liberation Army] was convicted in the 1973 killing of a [LOC New Jersey] State trooper . 
In 2006 , a student objected to the name of the center . 
In the ensuing controversy , CUNY’s chancellor ordered that it be changed . 
But it stuck . 
[PER Taf Sourov] , 19 , a member of the [ORG Revolutionary Student Coordinating Committee] , a group that regularly met there , said he believed the closing was retaliation for student protests against [PER David H. Petraeus] , the former [ORG CIA] director and military commander , who is teaching a course at the [LOC Macaulay Honors College] . 
“I practically lived out of the room , ” [PER Sourov] said . 
“I would do my homework in there .

[PER Dewhurst] wants to bill feds for undocumented prisoners 
[LOC AUSTIN] , [LOC Texas] -- Days after calling for the impeachment of President [PER Barack Obama] , Lt. Gov. [PER David Dewhurst] is demanding that the president pay for the 130,000 undocumented immigrants who are housed in county jails across [LOC Texas] -- a tab that could run nearly $157 million in the past two years alone . 
In a letter to [LOC Obama] , [PER Dewhurst] said the federal government should reimburse [LOC Texas] counties for the cost of housing the undocumented immigrants because the feds have failed to secure the [LOC U.S.] [LOC Mexico] border as they should have . 
" [MISC It’s] time we ask for that money back , " [PER Dewhurst] said in an email to supporters this week , asking them to sign a petition supporting his position . 
" It’s outrageous that county jails pay for housing to more than 130,000 people that illegally enter our state . 
" In my experience , I believe the immigration conversation begins and ends with strict border security , as our counties can no longer fund this massive financial burden . " 
In his letter to [LOC Obama] , [LOC Dewhurst] wrote: " The dollars expended in this fashion would be better spent enhancing law enforcement efforts to better protect our citizens . " 
No word yet from [LOC Washington] on what they think of Dewhurst’s demand , but don’t expect a check to be arriving anytime soon . 
[PER Dewhurst] , who has drawn three [MISC GOP] challengers in his re-election bid , has made a sharp turn to the right in his political rhetoric since losing a [LOC U.S.] [ORG Senate] runoff to tea party star [PER Ted Cruz] in July 2012 . 
Two weeks ago , [PER Dewhurst] publicly advocated [MISC Obama’s] impeachment at a tea party forum in [LOC Fort Worth] -- a move that drew surprise since it came from [ORG Texas’ No.] 2 officeholder . 
State and county officials have complained for years that detained immigrants are costing local taxpayers , and federal officials have declined to reimburse any costs because the jailed suspects are being held on local charges . 
Similarly , state officials have also complained that state prisons are holding thousands of undocumented immigrants who were convicted of state crimes . 
At one point last year , well over 12,000 state convicts had deportation detainers on them -- meaning that as soon as they complete their sentence or are paroled they are subject to being deported , officials said . 
Most are [MISC Mexican] citizens , prison officials said . 
Proposals to deport convicts serving time for nonviolent crimes before they were paroled have failed to gain support from legislative leaders , who feared if they were paroled and returned home they would simply slip back across the border into [LOC Texas] . 
The savings from that plan were estimated to be at least $15 million , officials said at the time .

[PER IKE SKELTON] , FORMER CONGRESSMAN FROM [LOC MISSOURI] , DIES AT 81 
[PER Ike Skelton] , a [MISC Democratic] congressman who was ousted in the [MISC Republican] sweep of 2010 after serving his [LOC Missouri] district for more than 30 years , died Monday in [LOC Arlington] , [LOC Va] . 
He was 81 . 
His death was confirmed by the law firm [PER Husch Blackwell] , where [PER Skelton] was a partner . 
He died at [ORG Virginia Hospital Center] after a brief illness , according to a statement from his family . 
[PER Skelton] , who was first elected to the [ORG House] in 1976 , was known as an expert on national defense and served as the chairman of [ORG House Armed Services Committee] from 2007 until leaving office . 
He was re-elected time and time again in a deeply conservative district that stretches from the [LOC Kansas City] suburbs to the [MISC Ozarks] , and he had a long record of supporting two local military institutions: [LOC Fort] [PER Leonard Wood] and [LOC Whiteman] [ORG Air Force Base] , which he secured as the base for the nation’s fleet of B-2 bombers . 
“He led an exemplary life of honor , courage and public service , ” [PER Maurice Watson] , the chairman of [PER Husch Blackwell] , said Monday in a statement . 
“His commitment to our country , the state of [LOC Missouri] and the men and women who serve our nation in the armed services was unsurpassed.” 
[PER Skelton] was a social conservative who supported gun rights , opposed abortion rights and voted against President [PER Barack Obama’s] health care law . 
Before his defeat , he had not received less than 60 percent of the vote since 1982 . 
But that record was not enough to overcome the national tide of [MISC Republicans] elected to the [ORG House] in 2010 . 
Rep. [PER Vicky Hartzler] , the [MISC Republican] who beat [PER Skelton] and still holds the seat , received support from [ORG many Tea Party] members and tied him to Rep. [PER Nancy Pelosi] , [ORG D-Calif.] , then the House speaker . 
[PER Skelton] was born in [LOC Lexington] , [LOC Mo.] , and won his first election in 1956 to become the prosecuting attorney in [ORG Lafayette County] . 
He served in the [LOC Missouri] state [ORG Senate] before entering [ORG Congress] . 
After leaving the [LOC House] , he became a partner at [PER Husch Blackwell] , working in its [LOC Missouri] and [LOC Washington] offices . 
He is survived by his wife , [PER Patricia Martin] , and three sons . 
[PER Scott] rejects Bar 's lists 
[ORG Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau] 
[LOC TALLAHASSEE] — Gov. [PER Rick Scott] , seeking to bring the court system more in line with his conservative outlook , has repeatedly rejected lists recommended to him by the [ORG Florida Bar of] lawyers seeking to screen candidates for judgeships . 
[PER Scott] has rejected dozens of attorneys the [LOC Bar] has nominated to serve on judicial nominating commissions , created decades ago to professionalize the bench and make merit and qualifications at least as important as political connections . 
" He wants people with humility , " says [MISC Scott’s] chief counsel , [PER Pete Antonacci] , " and he wants judges who will follow the law and not make it up as they go along . " 
[ORG The Bar] said Scott’s two predecessors , [PER Charlie Crist] and [PER Jeb Bush] , never rejected any of its nominees . 
All 26 nominating commissions for the trial and appellate courts and the [ORG Supreme Court] are composed of nine members . 
[PER Scott] appoints five members of his choosing and must appoint four others from lists provided by the [ORG Bar’s Board of Governors] , some of whom are liberal [MISC Democrats] who did not support Scott’s election . 
The governor has rejected the lists 16 times and has never publicly given a reason and is not required to do so . 
[PER Scott] has sent back so many Bar-recommended names that the group keeps a five-page spreadsheet to track them . 
Lawyers who are registered [MISC Democrats] , are aligned with left-leaning groups or who promote themselves as trial lawyers appear to have little hope of gaining the governor’s favor . 
Scott’s list of rejections includes: 
* [PER Benjamin Crump] of [LOC Tallahassee] , a criminal defense lawyer honored by the [ORG NAACP] for his legal advocacy and who is best known for his firm’s representation of the family of [MISC Trayvon] [PER Martin] . 
* [PER Lynn Drysdale] , a consumer protection lawyer with [ORG Jacksonville Area Legal Aid] who has testified before [ORG Congress] in opposition to state laws that allow payday lenders to target military personnel . 
* [PER W.C. Gentry] , a high-profile trial lawyer in [LOC Jacksonville] who was a member of the legal ' 'd ream team’' that successfully sued the tobacco industry in the 1990s . 
A former county school board member , he has generously contributed to [MISC Democratic] candidates and has given money to [MISC Republicans] , too . 
* [PER Tiffany Faddis] , a trial lawyer , board member of the trial bar’s statewide lobbying arm , the [ORG Florida Justice Association] , incoming president of the [ORG Hispanic Bar Association] of [LOC Central Florida] and a registered [MISC Republican] . 
[PER Antonacci] said lawyers with such backgrounds are more likely to have a " living constitution’' view of the law as evolving and ever-changing , which he said is at odds with Scott’s views . 
He said he did not know what the [LOC Florida] Bar’s agenda was in choosing which lawyers to send to [PER Scott] , and defended the practice of rejecting Bar names . 
" The [ORG Florida Bar] is not an accountable organization in any electoral way , " [PER Antonacci] said . 
" The accountability in the process is with the governor . " 
A spokeswoman for the [LOC Bar] , [PER Francine Walker] , said: " The [ORG Florida Bar] respects that the governor can reject nominees it submits . " 
[PER Deirdre Macnab] , president of the [ORG League of Women Voters] of [LOC Florida] , criticized [MISC Scott’s] frequent pattern of rejecting [MISC Bar-supported] lawyers . 
" I believe it’s unprecedented , " [PER Macnab] said . 
" This is a pretty blatant example of politicizing the court , and citizens should be concerned . 
… It’s disheartening . " 
[PER Macnab] serves on a statewide judicial nominating panel for federal judges and was appointed by [LOC U.S.] [MISC Sens.] [PER Bill Nelson] , a [MISC Democrat] , and [PER Marco Rubio] , a [MISC Republican] . 
Former [MISC Republican] state Sen. [PER Alex Villalobos] of [LOC Miami] , president of Democracy at Stake , a bipartisan group that advocates an independent judiciary , said he regretted voting more than a decade ago to weaken the [MISC Bar’s] role in judicial selection . 
Prior to that , the [LOC Bar] had three automatic slots on every [ORG JNC] . 
" That was a mistake , " he said . 
" We’re reaping what we sowed . " 
[PER Antonacci] said the pace of rejections is likely to quicken , because terms of 78 JNC members are scheduled to expire by June . 
All 78 were appointed by Scott’s predecessor and likely 2014 opponent , [PER Crist] . 
Since becoming governor in 2011 , [PER Scott] has appointed more than 100 judges statewide .

For the [ORG OP] , a conspiracy would mean there is a hidden agenda of some type . 
In this instance it 's the same agenda as before . 
Things will get better when [PER Bush] is out of office . 
maybe if you guys had some actual facts to go along with your loony tunes theories it might mean your not insane 
The irony is delicious . 
Maybe if you could find a fact or two inside that rubber room of a head of yours , people would take you seriously .

[PER Béla Biszku] ( age 92 ) , the former [MISC Hungarian] Interior Minister during communism , has been convicted of war crimes . 
A court in [LOC Hungary] has sentenced him to five and a half years in prison . 
The once-eminent pro-Soviet functionary is responsible , according to the indictment , for the death of dozens of [MISC Hungarians] shot dead during the anti-Communist and anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 . 
Biszku was found guilty today of other crimes , including denying the crimes committed during the communist regime . 
In [LOC Hungary] denial of the crimes of communism and Holocaust denial are felonies . 
The former politician may now appeal the verdict . 
Biszku is alleged to have been a member of a commission that ordered the killing of civilians during the protests of 1956 . 
His trial began in mid-March and has attracted a great deal of attention in the [MISC Hungarian] media . 
The ex-minister was able to be convicted on the basis of a law promoted and enforced by the conservative [ORG Fidesz] party of current Prime Minister [PER Viktor Orbán] that says the prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity are not subject to time limitations . 
Several thousand people died during the anti-Communist uprising in [LOC Hungary] in 1956 . 
The revolt was drowned in blood by a [ORG Soviet Army] military intervention . 
During the subsequent purges more than 200 people were executed , 22 000 ended up in prison , and 210 00 emigrated . 
" The revolt was drowned in blood by a [ORG Soviet Army] military intervention . "

[PER Colson] authored the 1971 memo listing [PER Nixon] 's major political opponents , later known as [PER Nixon] 's [LOC Enemies List] . 
A quip that " [PER Colson] would walk over his own grandmother if necessary " mutated into claims in news stories that [PER Colson] had boasted that he would run over his own grandmother to re-elect [PER Nixon] . 
In a February 13 , 1973 conversation , [PER Colson] told [PER Nixon] that he had always had “a little prejudice.” Plotz reports that [PER Colson] sought to hire [ORG Teamsters] thugs to beat up anti-war demonstrators . 
[PER Colson] also proposed firebombing the [ORG Brookings Institution] and stealing politically damaging documents while firefighters put the fire out . 
[PER Colson] 's voice , from archives from April 1969 , was heard in the 2004 movie Going Upriver deprecating the anti-war efforts of [PER John Kerry] . 
[PER Colson] 's orders were to " destroy the young demagogue before he becomes another [PER Ralph Nader] . " 
In a phone conversation with [PER Nixon] on April 28 , 1971 , [PER Colson] said , " This fellow [PER Kerry] that they had on last week.. . 
He turns out to be really quite a phony . " 
Watergate and [PER Ellsberg] scandals 
[PER Colson] also became involved in the [ORG Committee] to [ORG Re-elect] the President ( [ORG CRP] or CREEP ) . 
At a [ORG CRP] meeting on March 21 , 1971 , it was agreed to spend $250,000 on " intelligence gathering " on the [ORG Democratic Party] . 
[PER Colson] and [PER John Ehrlichman] appointed [PER E. Howard Hunt] to the [LOC White House] Special Operations Unit ( the so-called " Plumbers " ) which had been organized to stop leaks in the [PER Nixon] administration . 
[PER Hunt] headed up the [MISC Plumbers'] burglary of [ORG Pentagon] Papers-leaker [PER Daniel Ellsberg] 's psychiatrist 's office in September 1971 . 
[LOC The Pentagon] Papers were military documents about the [MISC Vietnam War] which helped increase opposition to the war . 
[PER Colson] hoped that revelations about [PER Ellsberg] could be used to discredit the [MISC anti-Vietnam War] cause . 
1 . All by-products of the " [MISC Grassy Knoll] " 
2 . Everybody should read this before the liberal media whitewashes this asshole 's past I tried real hard to remember that [PER Colson] was a human being and he had friends and relatives who cared about him and would feel sorrow that he croaked . 
But you know what ? 
None of his friends/relatives did anything to stop him from being a miserable piece of shit . 
So fuck him and fuck them too . 
I 'm non " happy " he 's taking a dirt nap , but I 'm not unhappy either . 
He is responsible for all the [MISC Roves] , Atwaters , and even the Breitbarts who came after him .

Advisory for Tuesday , Sept. 24th @ 10 am 
Mine Workers and Supporters to [ORG Encircle Peabody HQ in] [LOC Downtown St. Louis] 
[LOC Union] says retirees and dependents must receive health care benefits earned during decades of labor in company mines 
[LOC St. Louis] – Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march around the headquarters of [ORG Peabody Energy] in [LOC St. Louis] this coming Tuesday , Sept. 24th . 
The event is the latest in a series of protests directed at the world’s largest private-sector coal company , which reported $90 million in net income in the second quarter of 2013 . 
[ORG Peabody] executives , however , are so far refusing to honor the company’s obligation to provide critically needed health care benefits for retired miners . 
[ORG Who: Mine] workers and supporters , including: 
· [PER Cecil Roberts] , International President , [LOC UMWA] 
· [PER Hugh McVey] , President , [LOC Missouri] [ORG AFL-CIO] 
· [PER Terrence Melvin] , President , [ORG Coalition of Black Trade Unionists] 
· [PER Claude Cummings] , Vice President , [ORG CWA District] 6 
· Rev. [PER Jonathan Stratton] , [PER Episcopal Diocese] of [LOC Missouri] 
[PER What:] March encircling [ORG Peabody Headquarters] , calling for the company to honor its obligations to retired miners and their dependents . 
When: Tuesday , September 24th , 10 am ( [LOC Central Time] ) 
Where: March to begin at [LOC Crowne] [LOC Plaza Hotel] , 200 [PER N. Fourth Street] . 
Marchers will proceed on [LOC Pine St.] to [LOC Broadway] , to Market . 
Then on [LOC Market Street] to circle around [ORG Peabody] headquarters along Market , Eighth , [PER Chestnut] and [ORG Seventh Streets] . 
Marchers will then proceed to [LOC Kiener Plaza] for a rally . 
“The [ORG Patriot Coal] chapter of this fight is behind us , now it’s time for [ORG Peabody Energy and] [ORG Arch Coal] to meet their responsibilities , ” said UMWA President [PER Roberts] . 
Last month , [ORG UWMA] members approved a settlement with [ORG Patriot Coal] , a company created by [ORG Peabody] in 2007 , which among other provisions established a mechanism for payment of health care benefits for retired miners . 
However , long-term funding for those benefits has not been secured . 
The union also won a court ruling in August establishing Peabody’s continued obligations to 3,100 miners and dependents , whose benefits remained with [ORG Peabody] at the time of the Patriot spinoff . 
[ORG Arch Coal] , another profitable company , dumped its retiree obligations into a company called [ORG Magnum Coal] in 2005 . 
Magnum was subsequently acquired by [MISC Patriot] , which entered bankruptcy reorganization last year . 
“This fight is anything but over , ” said [PER Roberts] . 
“Executives of these companies have to understand that miners and their families know the real story of what happened here – and because of our efforts , so do millions of working people across the country . 
Men and women worked underground for decades to earn these benefits . 
These companies are profitable , and they must step up to meet their obligations to these retirees.” 
The union’s ongoing effort to win full benefits for all affected retired miners includes a lawsuit against [ORG Peabody] and [ORG Arch] , filed in [LOC West Virginia] ; legislation in [ORG Congress] to aid retired miners and their dependents , sponsored by both [MISC Republicans] and [MISC Democrats] ; and an ongoing public education , advertising and community action campaign . 
Additional information is available at [LOC FairnessAtPatriot.org] .

What was he gonna shoot at , rabbits ? 
2 . Gee , lucky someone wasn't killed he should be charged with attempted murder .

Attempted murder means that your intentions where to kill someone .

[MISC Afghan] may face death for alleged conversion 
A man in [LOC Afghanistan] is being prosecuted in a [LOC Kabul] court and could be sentenced to death after being charged with converting from [LOC Islam] to [LOC Christianity] , a crime under the country 's [MISC Islamic] sharia laws , a judge said Sunday . 
The trial highlights a struggle between religious conservatives and reformists over what shape [MISC Islam] will take here four years after the ouster of the [MISC Islamic] fundamentalist [ORG Taliban] regime . 
The defendant , [PER Abdul Rahman] , 41 , was arrested last month after his family accused him of becoming a [MISC Christian] , according to Judge [PER Ansarullah Mawlavezada] . 
[PER Rahman] was charged with rejecting [MISC Islam] . 
His trial started Thursday . 
Hmm . Looks like you beat [PER Brandon] by 29 minutes 
Does anyone know if there has been an outcome to this trial ? 
On [ORG CBC] radio this morning , the quoted an [MISC Afghan] prosecutor as saying the man is now considered mentally incompetent to stand trial . 
In yet another indication of the involvement of [MISC Pakistani] establishment in the 26/11 [LOC Mumbai] attack , LeT operative [PER David Headley] has corroborated the statement of lone captured terrorist [PER Ajmal Amir] [LOC Kasab] that the terrorists got training from [LOC Pakistan] Navy . 
During his interrogation , [LOC Kasab] confessed that the ten terrorists , including himself , who attacked [LOC Mumbai] received training of swimming and underwater diving from the [ORG Pakistan Navy] 's frogmen . 
A frogman is someone who is trained to dive , swim and combat . 
" The role of frogmen was confirmed by [PER Headley] when the [MISC Indian] investigators interrogated him in the [LOC US] last month , " an official said . 
This is being seen as another clear indicator of the [MISC Pakistani] establishment 's involvement in the planning and execution of the [LOC Mumbai] terror attack , which claimed 168 lives . 
Home secretary [PER Gopal K Pillai] had recently said that the [ORG ISI] was " literally controlling and coordinating the ( [LOC Mumbai] ) attack from beginning to end " . 
[PER Pakistani-American Headley] , currently in [MISC American] custody , was interrogated by a team of [ORG National Investigation Agency] . 
Officials said that the [MISC Indian] investigators so far have no plan to interrogate [PER Headley] 's accomplice [PER Tahawwur Hussain Rana] , a [MISC Pakistani] origin [MISC Canadian] citizen , as his involvement in the [LOC Mumbai] attack conspiracy was limited to providing finance . 
" If necessary we may interrogate [PER Rana] also , though we have no immediate plan to do so , " an official said . 
[PER Headley] has also told his interrogators that the [MISC Pakistani] intelligence agency had paid Rs 25 lakh to LeT to purchase a boat which terrorists used to travel from [LOC Karachi] to the [MISC Pakistani] maritime boundary , where they hijacked an [MISC Indian] fishing boat 'Kuber' to reach [LOC Mumbai] . 
[PER Headley] also identified through voice sample test two [ORG ISI] officers believed to be constant contact with the terrorists who carried out the 60-hour attack in [LOC Mumbai] on November 26 , 2008 . 
Officials said [MISC Indian] investigators have information that [ORG ISI] chief Lieutenant General [PER Ahmed Shuja Pasha] had met one of the handlers of the [LOC Mumbai] attack , [PER Sajjid Mir] , who is currently in a [MISC Pakistani] jail . 
" All this information have been shared by [LOC India] with [LOC Pakistan] through the multiple dossiers given to it , " the official said . 
This makes me puke . 
Nothing like going to murderers for Justice . 
It is sickening , but unfortunately we don't have many options at this point . 
Hi Everyone 
[LOC Ill] explain my story ; 
I was a Gamesmaker for the [LOC London] 2012 games , and basically as a " [MISC Games Graduate] " i went for a interview on Monday at a Jobcentre In [LOC London] , Now i have a previous conviction which i was not convicted of , i was mistaken for someone but i was found guilty for 7 months until it was appealed at the high court ; now they made me do a [ORG CRB] check but will this come up on a Government [ORG CRB] ? 
or do you think it might be just a basic one ? 
seeing as i had to be [ORG CRB] for the [MISC Olympics] and they didn't say anything 
Im bumping 
x 
I believe it would come up on a [ORG CRB] enhanced check but that you would have nothing to worry about as the case was overturned . 
As an ex-employer I had to have [ORG CRB] checks done for all my staff and many had convictions , it is up to the discretion of the employer how serious the convictions are to them and their business - I can't see from what you have said how this 'conviction' would be held against you . 
Long as you wasn't acquited due to a technicality and it 's just you who 's claiming to be mistaken for someone else , then it 's all good . 
It'll show on enhanced CRB checks . 
Not sure about basic [ORG CRB] checks . 
The Crime that i was found Guilty for , was [ORG Benefit Fraud] so that 's why im a bit worried working in a Jobcentre , but then it was someone who uses these forum 's who set me up on my previous account , who managed to use all my Identity and then i got convicted but overturned by a high judge 
No It will not . 
LOCOG and the [ORG ODA] used Disclosure [LOC Scotland] for their checks 
this is a new movie that premiered the other day at [LOC Sundance] . 
It stars [PER John Cusack] as a right winger whose wife has been killed in action over in [LOC Iraq] . 
Instead of telling his two daughters about the death of their mother , he instead puts that off , and decides to take them on a road trip . 
The movie has gotten incredible buzz and was bought by [PER Harvey Weinstein] and company the first day it premiered , for a reported 4 million . 
The reviews of this movie seem to be pretty chilling . 
One reviewer talked about how instead of making a movie about the horrors of actual combat and the horrors of war , this film does what few movies I can think of at least in the war film genre seem to ever do: it focuses on wars effects on family members . 
One reviewer talked about how " the pain and terror in [LOC Cusacks] face ( while trying to tell his daughters ) never leaves " . 
I think this film really is something special and cant wait to see it . 
This could be one hell of a movie . 
[LOC Vancouver] pot activist [PER Marc Emery] to plead guilty to [LOC U.S.] drug charge 
No hope of avoiding extradition , plea deal made 
[PER Marc Emery] is facing extradition on three drug charges for selling marijuana seeds by mail order to customers in the [LOC U.S] . ( [ORG CBC] ) 
Marijuana activist [PER Marc Emery] says he plans to drop his fight against extradition to the [LOC U.S.] and plead guilty to one charge of drug distribution in a [LOC Seattle] courtroom next month . 
[PER Emery] 's extradition hearing in [LOC Vancouver] was adjourned on Wednesday so his lawyer could negotiate a deal with the [LOC U.S.] district attorney in which [PER Emery] could spend up to eight years in jail for one charge , while two other more serious charges are dropped , he said . 
" I will be making a guilty plea to one count of marijuana distribution this summer , and then when I 'm sentenced the [LOC U.S.] district attorney is going to be asking for five to eight years in a federal [LOC U.S.] penitentiary , " he told [ORG CBC News] on Wednesday . 
After the guilty plea , [PER Emery] expects he will be sentenced in August or September and is hoping he will eventually be transferred to a [MISC Canadian] jail . 
Joint [MISC U.S.-Canada] bust 
This is not the first time the marijuana activist has said his lawyers are cutting a deal with [LOC U.S.] prosecutors . 
In July 2008 , [PER Emery] said he had made a deal in which he would serve a minimum of five years in jail , but he later blamed [MISC Canadian] authorities when the deal fell through . 
The marijuana activist is facing drug charges for selling pot seeds to [LOC U.S.] customers , after his [MISC Vancouver-based] mail order business was busted in a joint operation involving both [LOC U.S.] and [MISC Canadian] law enforcement agencies in 2005 . 
He 's been fighting extradition ever since , but on Wednesday he said he now realizes it 's a fight he 's not going to win . 
" Ultimately my lawyer is convinced that the [MISC Canadian] government has never refused an extradition request from the [LOC United States] and it 's not going to start now , " he said . 
" Sometimes you have to face up to the reality of what 's going to happen , and under this scenario I may be free out of prison in two or three or four years , " he said . 
Without the deal , [PER Emery] said , he would be facing much more time in jail . 
" This is a preferential arrangement to the not-so-good-arrangement that would see me spend 10 , 20 , 30 years in a [LOC U.S.] federal penitentiary , foreseeably the rest of my life , and that doesn't give a person a lot of hope , " he said . 
Prepared to do time 
" The [ORG DA] wants to paint me as a large player providing a lot of marijuana to people , and we'll bring up that it was only seeds and it was totally transparent . 
It was done in [LOC Canada] out in the open for 10 or 12 years , " he told [ORG CBC News] during an interview at the busy downtown [LOC Vancouver] hemp store he still operates . 
" I didn't keep any of the money — $4 million . 
I gave it all away to activist groups around the world , so my motives are unusual , so that does mitigate in sentencing , " said [PER Emery] , who frequently ran in provincial and federal elections as the leader of the [ORG Marijuana Party] . 
But the man who once spent more than two months in a [MISC Canadian] prison for passing a joint to an undercover officer is now preparing for a much longer stay in a [LOC U.S.] prison . 
" You 've got to keep busy in jail . 
You 've got to be reading , in my case writing . 
I'll be learning [MISC Spanish] , [MISC French] . 
You 've got to have projects , " he said . 
*sigh* 
That 's what happens when you have [PER Stephen Harper] in Parliament . 
[ORG Stupid Conservative Government] . 
It 's disgusting that instead of dealing with Mr. [PER Emery] like a responsible government should - we pass him off like a hot potato to the [LOC USA] for them to deal with , and to be prosecuted under their laws where he has no bargaining power and fewer rights . 
*spits* 
I hate seein the prince go to jail 
twas a stupid mistake though 
I can't believe it 's actually going to happen . 
I remember reading about this forever ago and thinking " ah he'll be fine " fuck man. . 
Fuck [LOC america] . 
Fuck [LOC america] . 
No , [LOC America] is alright , but fuck the [MISC American] government . 
Fuck the [MISC Canadian] government too . 
haha They're the ones who're gonna agree to extradite him , in the first place . 
It 's fookin rediculous that he will be sentenced to a few years in jail just for selling seeds . 
He should be praised , instead of martyred 
Fuck governments in general . 
Another innocent man falls victim to the Machine . 
When will the madness end ? 
It 's _a_fucking_shame_what 's _happening_to_him , _but_ he_is_a_little_out_there._Not_eaxctly_the_best_spo kesperson_for_marijuana 
Is your space bar broken ? 
YES 
Yes_it_is . 
yea he has always been a little nutty... . 
publicly speaking out about destroying the [ORG DEA] single handedly lol 
[LOC Emery] rocks . 
And he 's awesome . 
That 's a shame :/ 
[ORG IFC] signs deal to expand insurance to farmers in [LOC East Africa] 
[LOC NAIROBI] , Nov. 25 ( [ORG Xinhua] ) -- [ORG International Finance Corporation] ( [ORG IFC] ) has signed agreements with three partners to expand access to insurance to thousands of farmers and livestock herders in [LOC Kenya] and [LOC Rwanda] to help protect their crops , animals and livelihoods from weather-related risks and natural disasters . 
[ORG IFC] , through the [ORG Global Index Insurance Facility] ( [ORG GIIF] ) , will confer grants totaling roughly 4.1 million [PER U. S.] dollars to the [ORG Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture/UAP Insurance] weather index insurance initiative in [LOC Kenya] ; the [ORG International Livestock Research Institute] ( [ORG ILRI] ) Livestock index insurance project in northern [LOC Kenya] ; and the [MISC MicroEnsure] weather index insurance project in [LOC Rwanda] . 
" These partnerships highlight [ORG IFC] 's commitment to expanding insurance and other financial products where they are needed most in [LOC Africa] . 
The [ORG Global Index Insurance Facility] will facilitate farmers' access to credit , leading to increased productivity , improved livelihoods and greater food security , " [PER Jean Philippe Prosper] , [ORG IFC] Director for [LOC Eastern] and [LOC Southern Africa] said . 
" We are grateful to the donors that have generously provided funding and to our partners for supporting this program . " 
The grants , the first three provided under the [MISC GIIF] program , will help bring weather-related , index-based insurance to about 35 , 000 farmers and 5,000 livestock herders in [LOC East Africa] over the next three years . 
" The implementation of these three first GIIF projects in [LOC Kenya] and [LOC Rwanda] will support the development of new insurance products and will increase expertise in this field , which will benefit smallholders and livestock keepers affected by climatic events , " he said . 
" In addition to the [LOC GIIF] , the [ORG European Union] is providing further financing to the [ORG ILRI Livestock Insurance] project in [LOC Kenya] through the 10th [ORG European Development Fund] , [ORG Kenya Rural Development Project] that will start in 2011 . " 
[ORG IFC] will confer a grant of up to 2.4 million dollars on [ORG Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture] , which expects to help insure 20,000 farmers in [LOC Kenya] over the next three years 
[ORG IFC] will confer a grant of up to 154,000 dollars on the [ORG ILRI] , which expects to help insure 5,000 livestock herders in northern [LOC Kenya] over the next two years . 
[ORG IFC] will confer a grant of up to 1.6 million dollars on MicroEnsure , which expects to insure 15,000 farmers in [LOC Rwanda] over the next three years . 
[ORG IFC] 's [ORG GIIF] program was established in 2009 to assist the development of index-based insurance for natural disasters and weather risks in developing countries , where insurance is rarely available . 
The grants will fund advisory activities , including local capacity building , infrastructure development , product development , and development of local insurance companies' capacity to provide index-based insurance products . 
Index-based insurance insures against catastrophic events , such as wind storms or droughts , depending on their severity . 
Index-linked insurance products eliminate the need for insurance companies to individually verify claims , reducing transaction costs and making it easier for the products and services to be offered to rural communities and in frontier regions . 
[ORG The European Union] committed 24.5 million euros as the first donor to the [ORG GIIF Trust Fund] . 
The fund is also supported by [LOC Japan] 's [ORG Ministry of Finance] with an initial grant of 2 million dollars , and the [ORG Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs] , which provided funding to establish the facility . 
[MISC French] far-left killer leaves jail 
[LOC ENSISHEIM] , [LOC France] , April 14 , 2010 ( AFP ) - 
A former militant of the [MISC French] far-left group [ORG Action Directe] , [PER Georges Cipriani] , left prison on parole on Wednesday after 23 years behind bars for two high-profile murders . 
A policeman at the scene confirmed to [ORG AFP] the identity of [PER Cipriani] , 59 , who left the prison in [LOC Ensisheim] in northeastern [LOC France] wearing a leather jacket and with long white hair . 
[PER Cipriani] was one of four members of [ORG Action Directe] sentenced to life in prison for the murder of [ORG Renault] chief [PER George Besse] in 1986 and the head of government arms sales [PER Rene Audran] a year earlier . 
The four included two women , [PER Joelle Aubron] who died of lung cancer in 2006 and [PER Nathalie Menignon] , who was paroled in 2008 . 
A fourth member , [PER Jean-Marc Rouillan] , remains behind bars . 
[PER Cipriani] left [LOC Ensisheim] in a police vehicle bound for an open prison near [LOC Strasbourg] where the police officer said he was due to do community service including working at a food bank as part of his parole . 
[LOC China] president urges child safety after school killings 
[LOC Beijing] , June 1 , 2010 ( AFP ) - 
[MISC Chinese] President [PER Hu Jintao] has called on the entire nation to do more to ensure the safety of children , state press said Tuesday , in comments that follow a spate of grisly school killings . 
" The entire society must pay importance to the safety of children and do everything to safeguard our motherland 's next generation , " the [ORG People 's Daily] quoted [PER Hu] as saying . 
[PER Hu] was speaking Monday as he toured a [LOC Beijing] exhibit on transport and building safety with a group of schoolchildren on the eve of [MISC International Children 's Day] , the report said . 
His remarks come after a spate of bloody school attacks around [LOC China] since late March which have left 17 people dead , including 15 students , and scores injured . 
Experts say the senseless assaults reveal a [LOC China] struggling to come to grips with rapid social change following decades of booming economic growth . 
On Sunday , a 47-year-old unemployed man was executed for carrying out an assault on 32 people , mostly small children , at a kindergarten in eastern [LOC China] in April . 
The man , [PER Xu Yuyuan] , wielded a knife usually used to slaughter pigs . 
[PER Xu] , who was sentenced to death on May 15 , told the court his motive was to vent his rage against society after losing money gambling and in business dealings , and suffering setbacks in his personal life . 
In late April , a former doctor who stabbed eight schoolchildren to death in a March school attack was executed . 
Two other school assailants have committed suicide . 
Premier [PER Wen Jiabao] said last month that long-standing social concerns including joblessness and a gaping rich-poor divide were partially to blame for the string of attacks . 
" We need to resolve the deep-seated causes that have resulted in these problems , " [PER Wen] said in an interview with [MISC Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television] . 
" This includes handling social contradictions , resolving disputes and strengthening mediation at the grassroots level . " 
Gadhafi attacks [LOC US] in speech in [LOC Italy] 
[LOC ROME] 2009-06-11 13:34:38 [ORG UTC] 
[MISC Libyan] leader [PER Moammar Gadhafi] on Thursday urged the world to understand what motivates terrorists , and likened the 1986 [LOC U.S.] strikes on [LOC Libya] to [PER Osama bin Laden] 's terror attacks . 
[PER Gadhafi] , who was long accused of sponsoring terrorism , got tepid applause from the [MISC Italian] lawmakers he addressed on the second day of a trip to [LOC Italy] , [LOC Libya] 's former colonial ruler . 
" It is not very intelligent to chase terrorists down the [MISC Afghan] mountains or central [LOC Asia] , " [PER Gadhafi] said in the hour-long speech . 
" That 's impossible . 
We must look at their reasons . " 
He called for dialogue with terrorists , saying , " One must talk to the devil , if it brings about a solution . " 
Sarcastically , he asked , " What 's the difference between the [LOC U.S.] airstrikes on our homes and bin [MISC Laden] 's actions ? " 
If anything , he said , bin [MISC Laden] is an outlaw , while the [LOC United States] is a country that should abide by international law . 
Former President [PER Ronald Reagan] ordered airstrikes on [LOC Tripoli] and [LOC Benghazi] in April 1986 after an attack on a disco in [LOC Germany] killed three people , including two [LOC U.S.] servicemen . 
The [MISC Libyans] say the retaliatory attacks killed 41 people , including [PER Gadhafi] 's adopted daughter , and injured 226 others . 
The [MISC Libyan] leader told the lawmakers he was being intentionally provocative " in order to try and understand acts of terrorism . " 
[PER Gadhafi] had long been ostracized by the [LOC West] for sponsoring terrorism , but in recent years sought to emerge from his pariah status by abandoning weapons of mass destruction and renouncing terrorism in 2003 . 
[LOC Libya] has since agreed to pay compensation to the families of the [LOC Berlin] disco victims as well as the families of the victims of the 1988 [ORG Pan Am] 103 bombing over [LOC Lockerbie] , [LOC Scotland] , which killed 270 people , including 189 [MISC Americans] . 
[MISC Libyan] [PER Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi] was convicted of blowing up the plane . 
The [LOC United States] restored diplomatic ties with [LOC Libya] in 2006 and removed the [MISC North African] nation from the [ORG State Department] list of countries that sponsor terrorism . 
[PER Gadhafi] 's visit to [LOC Italy] continued that process of emergence from international isolation . 
But it also drew protests , including at [LOC La] [MISC Sapienza] university , where [PER Gadhafi] was addressing a group of few hundred students . 
The speech to lawmakers was likely to raise more controversy . 
He had been set to speak inside the [ORG Italian Senate] , a rare honor for visiting dignitaries . 
But opposition lawmakers balked , forcing the speech to be moved to a palazzo next door . 
[PER Enrico Morando] , a senator of the opposition [ORG Democratic Party] , said [PER Gadhafi] 's presence at the [ORG Senate] would have been a " humiliation of this country 's democratic and republican spirit . " 
" Only those who have the credentials _ in terms of democracy and protection of human rights _ are entitled to speak to Parliament , the inviolable temple of democracy , " he told [ORG La Repubblica] newspaper . 
Human rights organizations and other critics have also denounced a recent deal that allows [LOC Italy] to send immigrants back to [LOC Libya] if they are intercepted at sea . 
They also decried [LOC Libya] 's treatment of the migrants and its poor human rights record . 
Protests intensify in [LOC Bolivia] over gasoline prices 
[LOC LA PAZ] , [LOC Bolivia] 2010-12-31 01:59:04 [ORG UTC] 
Protests against a sharp increase in fuel prices intensified and turned violent in [LOC Bolivia] on Thursday , as thousands of demonstrators demanded President [PER Evo Morales'] government repeal the hike . 
Demonstrators filled the streets in [LOC La Paz] and other cities to protest the higher prices , which were announced suddenly on Sunday , prompting an immediate 73 percent jump in gasoline prices and an 83 percent rise in prices for diesel . 
It also led to rapid increases in transport and food prices in the [MISC Andean] country . 
Some demanded the resignation of [PER Morales] , a close ally of [MISC Venezuelan] President [PER Hugo Chavez] . 
It has been the most unpopular measure of [MISC Morales'] five-year presidency . 
Taxi drivers held a strike that largely paralyzed [LOC La Paz] on Thursday , and protests were also held in the cities of [LOC Cochabamba] , [LOC Santa Cruz] , [LOC Potosi] and [LOC Oruro] . 
The march in the capital began peacefully but clashes with police erupted when demonstrators tried to enter the main plaza where the government palace is located . 
Police used tear gas to disperse the protesters , who hurled stones at officers , the vice president 's office , a union headquarters and two ministry buildings . 
In [LOC El Alto] , neighboring the capital , demonstrators set afire a car and toll booths . 
People lined a bridge while protesters raised fists demanding the measure be repealed . 
Interior Minister [PER Sacha Llorenti] said disturbances in [LOC La Paz] , [LOC El Alto] and [LOC Cochabamba] left 15 police officers injured , two seriously . 
A group of protesters burned a [MISC Venezuelan] flag . 
" We make a call for calm , for tranquility ; there are police on patrol to guarantee security , " [PER Llorenti] told a news conference . 
Fuel prices had been frozen for six years , but the government said it could no longer afford to subsidize them , especially since much is smuggled across the border to neighboring countries . 
Responding to the protests , [MISC Morales'] government has announced steps aimed at mitigating the economic effects _ including 20 percent salary increases for public workers aimed at offsetting higher fuel prices . 
The government also announced new assistance to rice , corn and wheat farmers intended to increase production and bring down prices . 
Demonstrators have called their protest the " gasolinazo . " 
Neighborhood protest leader [PER Claudio Luna] said in [LOC La Paz] that the government 's " message hasn't met the expectations of the population , and for that reason we're going to continue the protests . " 
He said demonstrators want prices lowered back to their former levels . 
Bus drivers have also held sporadic protests this week , demanding the government further increase fares . 
Authorities ordered raises of 60 to 80 percent in public transport fares , but bus drivers argue that isn't enough to offset the higher costs . 
Food prices have also risen 15 percent in subsidized government markets , but that remained much less than in private supermarkets . 
People seeking bargains lined up at a state-run food store in [LOC La Paz] on Thursday . 
[LOC Morales] , meanwhile , said in a news conference that he is inviting advisers from [LOC Paraguay] 's government to help formulate additional measures to lessen the blow of eliminating fuel subsidies . 
texas has the most hard core criminal justice system in the country . 
Is it a possibility there is another side to this ? 
Is it a possibility that this young man and his friend did not rape this girl ? 
Is it a possibility abc news has blown this out of proportion , twisted and distorted the facts ? 
[LOC Texas] criminal courts and prosecutors do not coddle to anyone . 
The football argument is an old one , not happening these days . 
Players these days get 4 game suspensions for selling a t shirt on e-bay . 
i 'd never heard of this case until now . 
So , i googled it to get more information . 
Even the information that is available is fuzzy . 
But it appears the prosecution struck a deal because of a lack of evidence . 
It seems the prosecutor is saying that everyone involved was drunk/drinking and that the stories told had holes in them...... . 
all of them . 
Hence , the 's lap on the wrists' . 
I 'm all for women/girls being able to do everything they want , in theory . 
However , the reality of the situation is that 16 year old girls should not place themselves in situations like this ( drinking to apparent excess ) while at a party not chaperoned by an adult . 
That said , young men should also not put themselves in that exact same situation because if you can't recount accurately what happened because you were drunk , you cannot say for sure what did or did not happen . 
As for the race angle , it is unecessary . 
This would have been no better or worse had the accused kids been white . 
bingo 
Why must we make this a race issue ? 
Really ? 
It 's a horrible thing that happened . 
Well then , why is it a HATE CRIME when a White person does it to a [PER Black] but not a HATE CRIME when it 's the other way around ? 
I don't think it is a race issue either . 
They need to throw these punks in jail ! 
Although you do make a good point that it 's only a hate crime if a white person picks on a black person . 
If it 's the other way around it 's no big deal for some reason . 
If she was my daughter , those 2 punks that raped her would be found one day after football practice in a ditch with a bullet in their heads . 
[LOC Amen] ! ! ! ! 
Because post racial [LOC America] is showing itself.. . 
the same people who don't not like [LOC Obama] because of his race post this kind of crap . 
You are an idiot . 
I don't like obama because he is a socialist pig . 
If the perps are black they are still guilty . 
I am tired of thugs crying that they get in trouble just because they are black and that society made them do it , bull ! ! ! ! 
They are thugs and deserve a bullet . 
They should have been expelled from school at a minimum . 
I guess you know the whole story and can make that objective assessment ? 
You need to learn the definition of socialist , then readjust your priorities . 
Nevertheless , the whole stereotype you described is complete bullshit . 
Nope . 
Wasn't there . 
My opinion is based on the information provided . 
Welcome to a message board . 
Funny you should say that . 
A cousin of mine was raped a long time ago , the guy that did it commit suicide shortly after - blew his own head off with a shotgun . 
BIG QUESTION ! 
Why the hell do guys rape women anyway ? 
Women are horny as hell ! 
All you have to do is be nice to them and they'll pretty much accomodate you in any way you want . 
Yes , sometimes you have to give them time to think about it... . 
Besides which sex with women that are voluntarily engaged is an awful lot better . 
[PER Young] guys need a talkin' to.. . 
A talking to ? 
How about jail ? 
16 year old girls do not consent to gang rape . 
No matter how " horny " or drunk they are . 
Please tell me you're not speaking from experience . 
You have to understand that in [LOC Texas] , Football is King and good football players are gods who can do no wrong . 
Worse than this has been swept under the rug for HS and college football stars there . 
No , I don't have to understand . 
Why is the title of your thread so insidious ? 
Why not a title lie " School Officials Screw over Rape Victim ? " 
That one would be more accurate . 
Because this is not Your Thread to name . 
Works for me . 
And that question Wasn't Directed At You . 
Still doesn't bend reality now does it ? 
Not only did 4 Blacks rape this girl , the main perp only received [MISC ANGER MANAGEMENT] class with no jail time ! 
The girl was just 16 , a cheerleader at [ORG Silsbee High School] in [LOC Texas] . 
She was at a party in 2008 when football star [ORG Rakheem Bolton] , fellow player [PER Christian Roundtree] and another boy pushed her into a bedroom and locked the door , held her down , and sexually assaulted her.. . 
When others tried to enter the room , [ORG Bolton] and [PER Roundtree] jumped out a window , leaving their clothes behind . 
The girl filed charges , but that didn't put an end to her trauma . 
Sphincteric school superintendent [PER Richard Bain Jr.] would make sure it only got worse . 
When the girl returned to school , administrators decided the best course of action was for the girl to slink away in a corner and try not to be seen . 
They told her to avoid the cafeteria and not take part in homecoming . 
Out of sight , out of mind . 
The kids were all teenagers , and the sex was claimed to be consensual . 
I have no idea whether it was , and neither does anyone of this forum . 
That remains to be seen . 
So yes , the title of this thread does kind of bend reality . 
Labour are a left wing socialist party . 
They are pro immigration if it supports the economy and believe in equal rights for all individuals . 
They are traditionally more likely and are known for allowing immigrants into the country - hence they were his target . 
The labour party was responsible for the current state of immigration in the country , and in his own ideology , he wanted to take our future labour politicians ( which those in the camp were potentially ) from getting into power and allowing more in . 
In his mind , by taking them out , he can prevent future immigration . 
can't believe it , [LOC norway] is such a friendly quiet country , this guy must be nuts they dont even have that many migrants , at least not compared to [LOC UK] ! 
He basically hates [PER Islam] and believes that [MISC Islamic] immigration is a huge threat to [LOC Europe] . 
He thinks that [MISC European] politicians are allowing the colonisation of [LOC Europe] by [MISC Muslims] and so are all legitimate targets . 
He thinks we need to deport all [MISC Muslims] from [LOC Europe] [LOC Turkey North] [LOC Iran] and [LOC Palestine] . 
He attacked his own kind because killing [MISC Muslims] would lead to them being replaced by more [MISC Muslims] . 
So instead he decided to take out " the next generation of Left wing seeds " . 
In short he has wiped out a number of potential future left wing politicians . 
He also sees himself a bit like a templar knight defending [LOC Christianity] from [LOC Islam] 
This . 
He isn't a [MISC White Supremacist] though . 
This is a bit of a myth . [LOC Oslo] is a hugely multicultural and as far as I 'm aware , [LOC Norway] as a whole is about on par with the [LOC UK] in terms of different ethnic groups . 
It 's a myth [MISC British] people seem to have that the [LOC UK] is one of the most multicultural places in [LOC Europe] , when in reality [LOC Sweden] , the [LOC Netherlands] and possibly [LOC Norway] are notably more so . 
I 'm not a fan of [PER David Cameron] . 
Thanks to his government , I'll likely be paying 3x as much as I would for university . 
I voted [ORG Labour] yesterday , I am a [ORG Labour] party member , with [MISC Scottish] roots . 
However , [PER David Cameron] *does* have a say , as do I , as do all of us , on whether we want the [LOC Union] to remain . 
[PER David Cameron] is the Prime Minister of the [LOC United Kingdom] . 
He has every right , and indeed , it should be his job to defend and persuade the [MISC Scottish] electorate and population that the [LOC United Kingdom] should remain , that [LOC Scotland] should vote no to any such referendum . 
I would vote no . 
The world is changing , with a strengthening east and a weakening west . 
If the [LOC UK] were to split , we would all become weakened . 
I agree , [MISC Scottish] independence is a matter for the [MISC Scots] , and should they vote for it , then that vote should be respected . 
But , personally , I believe rather than a breakup , the union should be reformed , so there is equality for all the nations . 
Bit of an off point - but I'll just say the 'West [MISC Lothian'] question and leave you with that . 
You argue that [PER David Cameron] should not be able to 'poke his big nose in' to the idea of [MISC Scottish] independence - yet , [MISC Scottish] MPs are able to do just that when certain [MISC English] affairs are debated in [LOC Westminster] ( something [MISC English] MPs are not able to do with [MISC Scottish] affairs ) . 
This is why there should be an appetite for reform within the Union - not a messy divorce that will leave us weakened , not strengthened . 
I don't agree that [MISC Scottish] should have a voice in [LOC Westminster] concerning England-only matters . 
Indeed , it would be far more pragmatic if we devolved the entire union -a parliament for every 5 or 10 million people in [LOC England] perhaps ? 
( [LOC North/Midlands/London/South] east/west ? ) 
I 'm sure there wouldn't be as much appetite for independence north of the border if the [MISC Scots] felt that they weren't subordinate to a parliament situated hundreds of miles away that doesn't really represent them ( [LOC Holyrood] is overwhelmingly full of centre-left MSPs , yet we effectively have a centre right majority government in [LOC Westminster] ) . 
I 'm not necessarily for or against independence . 
I haven't really read into it enough to decide . 
I fully support the decision to go independent though , if that is the outcome of the referendum , just as I would support the decision to remain in the union . 
I 'm not [MISC Polish] . 
That was my point . 
My grandfather settled in the [LOC Falkirk] area of [LOC Scotland] after the second world war ( having served alongside [MISC British] armed forces during the liberation of [LOC Europe] ) . 
I have [MISC Polish] ancestry , the same way [PER Cameron] has [MISC Scottish] ancestry . 
The idea that [PER Cameron] 's ancestry should entitle him to vote on matters concerning the [MISC Scottish] parliament is as ludicrous as my ancestry entitling me to vote in the [MISC Polish] Sejm . 
The argument that since [PER Cameron] is the prime minister of the [LOC UK] , he should have a voice is more legitimate , but it is not an argument I agree with . 
And if [LOC Brittany] wished to split , that is an issue for those living in [LOC Brittany] . 
If [PER Sarkozy] isn't from [LOC Brittany] , then his only job should be in ensuring that the split occurs legally . 
The argument that the whole of the [LOC UK] should vote on [LOC Scotland] 's independence is like saying the whole of the [ORG EU] should get to vote if the [LOC UK] ever holds an in/out Eu membership referendum . 
It 's completely absurd and there 's no justification for it . 
And what 's to say [LOC Scotland] will go bankrupt ? 
[LOC Iceland] , [LOC Norway] , [LOC Denmark] , [LOC Finland] , [LOC Austria] , [LOC Switzerland] , [LOC Lithuania] , [LOC Estonia] , [LOC Latvia] and [LOC Ireland] all have population sizes comparable to or smaller than [LOC Scotland] , and all function well as independent states . 
The [LOC Nordic countries] have some of the strongest economies in the world , as does [LOC Switzerland] . 
And the [MISC Irish] economy was , until recently , booming . 
[LOC Iceland] is a very interesting example . 
No major heavy industry , a population a little · over 1/3 of a million , universal healthcare and education ( free at university level at state universities ) and yet it manages to maintain one of the highest standards of living ( arguably the highest ) in the world . 
Claiming that [LOC Scotland] would go bankrupt in no time is ridiculous . 
It is entirely possible that [LOC Scotland] could follow the [MISC Nordic] example if it ever decides to vote for independence . 
People forget that [LOC Edinburgh] is a reasonably large financial centre ( relatively large for a country of 5 million ) and that central [LOC Scotland] was a cradle for the industrial revolution . 
Add to that revenue from hybrocarbon extractions in the north sea , fishing exports , and the ability to become reasonably self-sufficient in renewable energy ( wind , tidal , hydroelectric -there 's potential for it on [LOC Scotland] 's rugged landscape ) and I see no reason why [LOC Scotland] would be unable to function as an independent nation . 
Apologies for misunderstanding your nationality . 
I think the difference with [LOC Scotland] to those [MISC Nordic] economies is that [LOC Scotland] 's current expenditure is higher than it would be ovule were to split . 
It is enormously dependent on the support of the whole of the [LOC UK] . 
It would have to scrap free university fees , it wouldn't have the [ORG NHS] , thus [LOC UK] infrastructure employs many [MISC Scots] . 
If it wasn't to go bankrupt it would certainly struggle for decades . 
The [ORG EU] example just isn't the same at all . 
The [ORG EU] is not a country that actively supports each other economically ( other than bailouts ) as much as a country does , it isn't as socially connected , it employs an extremely small percentage of people , they aren't politically connected and have no national identity . 
[MISC You're] an idiot . 
Loads of " far right " parties advocate high taxes , why ? 
Because it 's based on jealousy . 
Poor white folks blame their own poverty on the rich . 
[PER Hitler] had an extensive welfare state , the [ORG BNP] would punish the bankers to the point of destroying what is quite possibly the only real money maker the [LOC UK] has . 
Lol banking is the only real money maker the [LOC UK] has.. . 
well firstly that isn't true and secondly they pay a pathetically small amount of taxes anyway so provide next to nothing to this country . 
They pay a small percent by the overage sum is huge . 
Where else does the money the government spend come from ? 
Do you really think that the [LOC West] would lose to a bunch of countries that hate their own neighbours ? 
[LOC India] and [LOC Pakistan] hate each other and then there is [LOC China] who hate both . 
The [LOC Middle East] would just be destroyed if it was a total war . 
If anything , the 'arrogance' would increase as a result . 
There is no way in hell that [ORG NATO] would lose to those countries . 
[LOC Pakistan] is no match for [LOC India] now . 
And in the future [LOC Pakistan] will be a mere annoyance than a real threat . 
[LOC China] and [LOC India] may have their differences , but they'll never go to war with each other . 
They both stand to lose too much in the process . 
[LOC China] is already wrapping a fist around the [LOC West] 's balls by buying up their debt and forcing the west to be economically dependent on them . 
Very smart those [MISC Chinese] . 
[LOC India] should eventually get in on the act , while weaning themselves off western investment , then when the time is right , they should use economic warfare to plunge western economies into chaos , crippling their financial power , and ultimately their military power . 
After a few months so the [LOC West] will be very vulnerable . 
We 've had to endure your cr*p for generations . 
We're a patient people . 
We don ; t have to rely on military power alone , and we can wait until the time is right . 
are you aware that the arabs and whites were rival powers until the white europeans overtook following the renaissance ? 
millions of white christians were enslaved by arabs . 
[LOC spain] , a white country was occupied by arabs for centuries . 
arabs conquered the old eastern roman empire , they attempted to invade [LOC europe] for centuries , finally being repelled at the battle of le panto . 
white people today and victims of massive levels of anti white violence all across the western world . 
[LOC america] especially . 
you are a racist . 
Oh , I feel so sorry for the poor white people , they 've had it sooooo bad . 
Who the hell are the blacks , who were enslaved by whites to complain ? 
Who the hell are the [MISC Indians] , who were enslaved and robbed blind by whites to complain ? 
They 've been sooo bad to the whites over the years , haven't they ? 
And it 's not like Blacks and [MISC Asians] ever suffer discrimination at the hands of whites , is it ? 
Poor whites . 
You have it so bad . 
Idiot . 
from all the other taxes businesses and people pay ? 
[ORG Barclays] paid £113m in corporation tax in 2009 if you combine it with all the other banks it doesn't even make £1billion so you are saying that in 2009 the only money the government made was £1billion ? 
This is what happens when you dont believe in equality or understand how countries make money . 
See people can learn to live with each other peacefully , not via segregation . 
Who is this 'we' ? 
[LOC Okay] , [LOC China] has the debt bought up , but if they were to be destroyed who would chase it up ? 
[LOC India] are no match for any [MISC Western] country , not even [LOC Belgium] . 
Are you going to send the slum kids to attack , or how about the frail women ? 
The [LOC West] has far more economic and military power than the [MISC East] , to suggest otherwise shows that you're delusional . 
1 ) Of course not , they haven't made them yet . 
So on what basis will you attack [LOC Iran] ? 
That they MAY acquire nuclear weapons . 
That is so ****ing silly . 
If the [LOC UK] were planning to abolish murder as a criminal charge in a few years time , could I go out and murder 100 people based on the intention , " Well , it 's going to be abolished anyway " . 
2 ) I beg to differ . 
It has repeatedly refused to declare several sites and when they were caught out they said they were going to declare them anyway . 
Evidence ? 
3 ) As I said before here you are , making a pipsqueak about it and you only have to have an open mind to know that [LOC America] 's being hypocritical . 
I Know [LOC America] AND [LOC ISRAEL] are being hypocritical . 
Yet no one is telling them that . 
First of all to put it into context [LOC Israel] didn't threaten [LOC Iran] . 
It 's been the warmongering on the mullahs' part after they decided they wanted [LOC Israel] destroyed for some obscure reason because their ideology advocated it . 
[LOC Iran] is not an [MISC Arab] country , the [MISC Israel-Arab] conflict has absolutely nothing to do with [LOC Iran] . 
The mullahs have no right funding proxies there because they are getting involved in something that has nothing to do with them . 
The mullahs themselves see the [MISC Arabs] as more of an enemy than [LOC Israel] so this comparison is idiotic as there will never , ever be unity in the [LOC Middle East] amongst Muslims and I hope there never is either . 
( 1 ) Yet for 30 years , they didn't do anything . 
In fact , [LOC Iran] has never even waged war against [LOC Iran] which cannot be said for it 's neighboring countries . 
A very optimistic view . 
[LOC China] and [LOC Russia] don't want the [LOC US] to throw its weight around so they're using their veto as a feeble show of strength . 
By vetoing the criticism of [PER Assad] 's actions they want to show that they will not just follow [LOC America] 's lead on this one . 
( 1 ) [LOC Feeble:] [LOC America] 's looking feeble . 
They can't intervene and save their beloved " democracies in action " because of [ORG Russia/China] . 
There used to be a time when [MISC Americans] would say " **** the world , we are doing this " . 
Defending itself against what ? 
[ORG Hezbollah] was created by [LOC Iran] and [PER Khomeini] decided to send Revolutionary Guards there to train militants as a 'resistance' group . 
They don't seem to be doing much resisting by constantly firing rockets into [LOC Israel] are they ? 
That 's a whole different argument and frankly , this has nothing to do with it . 
As I said before the mullahs have no right to poke their nose into the [MISC Arab-Israel] conflict so whether [ORG Hezbollah] attacked first or otherwise , it doesn't justify their actions . 
The [MISC Afghan] security force was created by the [LOC US] and the coalition . 
Yet when they attack the people who they are " helping " , they are labelled terrorists . 
On the same scale , [LOC America] has no RIGHT to poke it 's nose at the [MISC Arab/Israel] conflict if [LOC Iran] hasn't got the same right . 
Why are there different rules for one country and different rules for other countries ? 
Well it 's obvious they'll say that but it 's obvious they're after a bomb . 
It 's so they can throw their weight around without fear of reprisal from [LOC America] or [LOC Israel] , not for use . 
They shouldn't be allowed nukes , period . 
As for an invasion , definitely not . 
why is [LOC israel] allowed nukes though . 
Okay [LOC Iran] should not have Nuclear weapons but [LOC Israel] has no right to say it , 
Its like a thief telling other people not to thieve because its illegal 
The same way I saw the [LOC US] invading [LOC Pakistan] instead of [LOC Afghanistan] even though [LOC Pakistan] have nukes . 
Because [LOC Pakistan] largely follows [MISC American] orders . 
The [LOC US] assisted them in developing nukes in the first place . 
As I said before [LOC Iran] initiated it.. . 
How ? 
For example ? 
The Shah seemed pretty content with staying out of it . 
The Shah 's absolutism was a knock-on effect . 
[PER Mossadegh] was going forward with social-democratic nationalism that had been popularised by [PER Nasser] and [MISC Arab] leaders , and this led to the 1953 coup . 
Where did I say that ? 
Note it was a question . 
Why do you keep jumping to conclusions . 
How did me explaining the reason for [LOC China] and [LOC Russia] 's veto somehow make me an [MISC American] lover . 
Bishy said that 'we 'd see more positive results from [LOC China] and [MISC Russia'] and I implied that the [MISC Chinese] and [MISC Russians] hold no sympathy for the [MISC Syrian] people rather they want to maintain their control and not have the [LOC US] throw its weight around . 
The way OP is written makes it a good guess you 'd be backing [MISC US-Israel] because you seemed to be agreeing with the proposed intervention by them , but fair enough if you're not . 
Though based on what you're criticising [LOC Iran] for , it should be quite a bit down on your priority list . 
No . 
I was just mentioning the [LOC Iran] bit.. . 
Why does the [LOC US] and [LOC Israel] having favoured factions justify [LOC Iran] to do the same . 
It doesn't justify it , but it puts their actions into context . 
On the same logic , being hit by someone doesn't justify hitting them , but it makes why you do ( if you do ) understandable . 
UPDATING AN EMAIL LAW FROM THE PAST CENTURY 
[PER Steven Warshak] , a [LOC Cincinnati] businessman who built an empire selling male sexual enhancement drugs , was convicted of wire fraud several years ago , based in large part on his email correspondence , which authorities had extracted via a subpoena under a 1986 law governing electronic privacy . 
A federal appeals court in [LOC Ohio] later found , however , that the government had violated Warshak’s constitutional right to privacy . 
The court said investigators should have convinced a judge that there was probable cause and obtained a search warrant , as though his messages had been stashed in a desk drawer . 
Although the court let the conviction stand , the case highlighted the conflicting legal rules that govern electronic privacy . 
[ORG Congress] is now set to clarify those rules , bringing that quarter-century-old law , the [ORG Electronic Communications Privacy Act] , or [ORG ECPA] , in line with the [MISC Internet] age . 
On Thursday , the [ORG Senate Judiciary Committee] will start deliberating a measure that would require the government to get a search warrant , issued by a judge , to gain access to personal emails and all other electronic content held by a third-party service provider . 
The current statute requires a warrant for emails that are less than 6 months old , but it lets the authorities gain access to older communications – or bizarrely , emails that have already been opened – with just a subpoena and no judicial review . 
The law governs the privacy of practically everything entrusted to the [MISC Internet] – family photos stored with a Web service , journal entries kept online , company documents uploaded to the cloud , and the flurry of emails exchanged every day . 
The problem is that it was written when the cloud was just a cumulus in the sky . 
[LOC Silicon Valley] companies as well as advocacy groups from the political left and right have been lobbying for change for many years , and reform legislation seems to be gaining broad political support . 
Even the [ORG Justice Department] appears to have approved one major change: requiring law enforcement to get a search warrant for all kinds of electronic content , no matter how long it has been in electronic storage or what exactly electronic storage means . 
“Changing the law has become more of an imperative because of the growth of cloud computing , because everyone including members of [ORG Congress] are storing sensitive info with third-party providers and they want it to be protected , ” said [PER Greg Nojeim] , senior counsel at the [MISC Washington-based] [ORG Center for Democracy and Technology] , which is financed partly by [LOC Silicon Valley] companies and which is part of a coalition pushing for reform . 
“The technology is advancing and people realize the law has to keep pace.” 
Updating the bill could have a broader impact on civil cases as well , clarifying who can gain access to emails , photos and [ORG Facebook] posts in corporate litigation and divorce court . 
It could also lay out clearer rules for government agencies like the [ORG Internal Revenue Service] to follow to gain access to private citizens’ emails . 
The agency told [ORG Congress] recently that it seeks search warrants before reading taxpayer emails , though its written policy says otherwise , according to an information request filed by the [ORG American Civil Liberties Union] . 
Courts across the country , apparently baffled by how to apply the existing law , which applies to content held in “electronic storage , ” have ruled in sometimes contradictory ways over the privacy of electronic material in both civil and criminal cases . 
In one prominent case , [PER Lee Jennings] sued a relative of his wife who broke into his [ORG Yahoo] account and ferreted out emails describing an extramarital affair that were later used as incriminating evidence in divorce proceedings . 
[PER Jennings] claimed a violation of his privacy under the electronic privacy act , but the highest court in his home state of [LOC South Carolina] held that his emails , which sat on Yahoo’s servers , were not held in “electronic storage” and therefore were not covered by the statute . 
A federal court in [LOC California] years earlier had ruled differently in another case , interpreting “electronic storage” far more broadly . 
Jennings’ lawyer , [PER Neal K. Katyal] , a former acting solicitor general in the [LOC Obama] administration , asked the [ORG Supreme Court] to reconcile the dueling interpretations . 
The court declined to hear the case this month , effectively leaving it to [ORG Congress] to clarify the law . 
Although the appeals court ruling in the [LOC Warshak] criminal case is binding only in the 6th Circuit , it has since become the default legal threshold for many Web companies . 
[ORG Facebook] says it turns over content created by users – pictures , posts , messages – only after it is served with a search warrant , though a subpoena suffices for basic subscriber information , including a user’s name and email address . 
Twitter , too , says “requests for contents of communication require a [LOC U.S.] search warrant , ” and it informs users when it receives a request for information from a government agency . 
[ORG Microsoft] , which operates email and cloud storage services , follows a similar practice , insisting on a search warrant for “content , ” including documents , photos , email and instant messages . 
With a subpoena , the company can divulge a user’s [ORG Internet Protocol] record , though , which can be used to establish a person’s location . 
“The law is so old it doesn’t account for how we have turned into a digital society , ” said [PER Bryan Schilling] , a lawyer at [ORG Microsoft] . 
He offered an offline analogy: “If somebody had a storage unit , law enforcement would be required to get a search warrant , ” he said . 
“It’s the same thing now , as we store more and more of our content in the cloud , consumer or enterprise.” 
The original sponsor of the 1986 law , Sen. [PER Patrick Leahy] , [ORG D-Vt.] , has called its overhaul his top priority for the year . 
He and Sen. [PER Mike Lee] , [PER R-Utah] , have introduced a measure requiring law enforcement to obtain a warrant for all electronic content , including emails , regardless of how old they are . 
That overhaul is backed by an unlikely coalition . 
Amazon and [ORG Google] , which offer cloud-based services to consumers and businesses , are lobbying for the change , along with startups like [ORG Evernote] and [ORG Tumblr] , which operate modern-day private diaries . 
They have joined with advocacy groups as diverse as the [ORG American Civil Liberties Union] and [ORG Americans for Tax Reform] . 
The issue of email privacy received the greatest attention last year , when Gen. [PER David H. Petraeus] , the former director of the [ORG Central Intelligence Agency] , resigned after an inquiry into his email correspondence turned up evidence of an extramarital affair . 
He and his biographer , [PER Paula Broadwell] , had exchanged amorous correspondence in a “draft” folder of a shared [MISC Gmail] account , apparently to elude detection . 
Those draft messages , because they had not been transmitted across the [MISC Internet] , could have been viewed by federal authorities with nothing more than a subpoena , according to current law . 
[PER GEORGE JONES] IN REAL LIFE AND REAL TIME 
Early in 1977 , a couple of years after he and [PER Tammy Wynette] had divorced , the country music star [PER George Jones] played a show at the [LOC Stardust Inn] in [LOC Waldorf] , [LOC Md.] , his first in the [LOC Washington] area in several years . 
I was then a young pop music critic at [ORG The Washington Post] , so it fell to me to write a profile of the notoriously hard-drinking singer . 
What followed was an experience so intense , so remarkable for its raw emotional force , that I could not help but think of it Friday , when it was announced that [PER Jones] had died in a [LOC Nashville] , [LOC Tenn.] , hospital at the age of 81 . 
That weekend I learned two important things about Jones: that there was very little distance between him and his songs , and that the same qualities that made him a great artist also made his life a torment . 
In those days he was still unashamedly carrying a torch for [PER Wynette] , who had left him because , as she put it in legal papers she filed , he “drinks to such an extent that he becomes completely and absolutely unmanageable.” 
On stage that weekend , he reworked songs like “She Thinks I Still Care” and “Picture Me Without [MISC You”] so that they included references to her , making them almost embarrassingly personal , as if she were in the audience and he was singing only to her . 
But it was on his tour bus between sets that I saw [PER George Jones] more achingly and nakedly vulnerable than any performer I have ever encountered , before or since that night . 
He was dressed in a flashy leisure suit and wore a pair of glittering diamond rings on his left hand , including one with his initials , but as he talked about [PER Wynette] and how much he still loved her , he began to weep . 
I don’t think he was drunk . 
He talked about how he was trying to stay dry for [PER Tammy] , who by that time had already re-married and divorced again . 
Within a year or two , he would develop a cocaine habit that would send his career off the rails , but there was no sign of that either . 
This was just [PER George Jones] in real life and real time . 
It is hard today , in a time when irony has become a dominant cultural mode and artists are screened from reporters by phalanxes of handlers , to imagine so public a breakdown happening or a celebrity letting his pain be so visible . 
But [LOC Jones] wasn’t ashamed or embarrassed by that display , and when he went back to the stage for a second set of what he described to me as “sad , sloppy tear-jerkers , ” his singing was even more passionate and inspired , with his twangy , somewhat nasal voice cracking in all the right places with what had to be genuine feeling , not artifice . 
Over a career that lasted nearly 60 years , [PER Jones] recorded more than 100 albums , and over and over again , he didn’t just sing the songs that were given to him . 
In the best of his recordings , as on that night , he also inhabited them , so that anyone listening to him could be sure: He really means it , he has really lived this song about heartbreak or hangovers and knows what it means , poor soul . 
As someone who grew up in [LOC Chicago] listening mostly to the blues , I had no special fondness for country music , whose only local outlet in those days was the radio station [ORG WJJD] . 
But seeing [PER George Jones] live for the first time that cold night in southern [LOC Maryland] was a revelation , because in his own highly idiosyncratic way he showed himself to be no less soulful a singer than [PER Howlin’ Wolf] on something like “How Many More Years” or [PER Otis Redding] on “I’ve [MISC Been Loving You Too] [MISC Long.”] 
Despite all the drinking and drug binges that would dog his career , [PER Jones] never lost that gift . 
In 2009 , assigned to write a profile of the [MISC Canadian] singer-songwriter [PER Leonard Cohen] for this newspaper , I walked into [LOC Cohen’s] [LOC New York] hotel suite to find him playing one of [MISC Jones’] late-career gems , “Choices , ” on his iPod . 
[PER Cohen] expressed great admiration for [PER Jones] and then recited one of the song’s most powerful verses: 
I was tempted 
By an early age I found 
I liked drinkin’ 
Oh , and I never turned it down 
There were loved ones 
But I turned them all away 
Now I’m living and dying 
With the choices I made 
@In part because of his consistent “nipping , ” as he called it , [PER Jones] never enjoyed the crossover success of his contemporaries [PER Johnny Cash] and [PER Merle Haggard] , and so his passing will probably not have the broad cultural resonance that Cash’s did . 
But he was , hands down , a superior singer , a fact obvious to everyone in the country music field: As [PER Waylon Jennings] once sang , “If we all could sound like we wanted to , we’d all sound like [PER George Jones.”] 
But even within the confines of “pure country , ” whatever that term might mean today , [PER Jones] did not stand still . 
He began his career very much in the mold of his idol [PER Hank Williams] , singing tunes about honky-tonks and carousing . 
He never lost his affection for that genre , but over the years he also evolved into a master of ballad singing , especially on his duets with [PER Melba Montgomery] and [PER Wynette] , both before and after they were married . 
And though a brief late ‘50s flirtation with rockabilly didn’t pan out , [PER Jones] also knew how to rock . 
It’s almost forgotten now , but he and [PER Elvis Presley] once were co-headliners on a [LOC Louisiana] [MISC Hayride] tour , and generations of rock 'n’ roll bands , including ones I played in , have covered songs like “Why Baby Why , ” “White Lightning” and “The Race Is On” and found them to be guaranteed crowd-pleasers . 
Beginning in the 1980s , [PER Jones] , with the help of his fourth wife , [PER Nancy Sepulvedo] , pulled himself out of his tailspin . 
But by then the country music mainstream had begun to move on to more polished styles , and [PER Jones’] visceral approach fell out of fashion . 
In recent years , [PER Jones] had thought of himself as a relic , and expressed bitterness at what he saw as the disregard for what he represented . 
All that may be true , but it can’t – and doesn’t – dim the magnificence of his achievements , any more than his personal weaknesses and demons did . 
[ORG DEATH ROW] INMATE ’ S REQUEST FOR DNA TESTING IS REJECTED 
The state of [LOC Mississippi] rejected on Monday a request to submit physical evidence for DNA testing made by a prisoner scheduled to be put to death Tuesday evening . 
[PER Willie J. Manning] , convicted in 1994 of murdering two college students , had been repeatedly rebuffed in the courts as he sought to have DNA tests performed on certain crime scene evidence . 
But the most recent requests came about because of two letters sent by the [ORG Justice Department] in recent days to the prosecutor who handled [MISC Manning’s] trial . 
The letters concerned the trial testimony of an [ORG FBI] expert asked to examine “hair fragments” found at the scene of the murders . 
The expert testified that in this case he could determine only that the hairs came from an [MISC African-American] but that hair comparison analysis was capable , given better samples , of matching a hair to a particular individual . 
[PER Manning] is black ; the murder victims were white . 
The prosecutor cited this testimony several times in his closing arguments . 
In a letter dated May 2 , the [ORG Justice Department] said the expert’s testimony about the general capability of hair analysis – that it could match a hair to a specific individual – was erroneous and “exceeded the limits of the science.” 
Then , in a letter dated May 4 , the department further said that such analysis could not “determine” that a hair came from a person of a certain race , as the expert testified at one point , only that the hair “possesses certain traits that are associated with a particular racial group.” 
The [ORG FBI] offered in both letters to perform DNA testing on the hair fragments . 
Manning’s lawyers argued that these letters constituted new evidence and thus that the hairs , as well as other evidence collected at the scene including a rape kit and fingernail scrapings , should be submitted for [MISC DNA] testing before [PER Manning] is put to death . 
In the response denying the requests , the state attorney general , [PER Jim Hood] , called the new requests a “red herring , ” saying that the letters did not “represent new evidence , ” nor did they repudiate the testimony given by the [ORG FBI] expert in 1994 . 
Manning’s lawyers are still lobbying the governor for a stay of execution . 
On Friday , Manning’s brother and the [ORG Mississippi Innocence Project] filed suit to preserve all the physical evidence for DNA testing even if the execution is carried out . 
FOCUS TURNS TO THREE SUSPECTS IN [MISC BELGIAN] DIAMOND ROBBERY 
[LOC PARIS] – Investigators in three countries continued unraveling the plot behind a brazen $50 million diamond robbery in [LOC Belgium] , focusing Thursday on a [MISC Swiss] lawyer , a real estate businessman and a [MISC French] luxury car exporter with a prison record for fraud . 
After a series of raids Tuesday and Wednesday in [LOC Switzerland] , [LOC Belgium] and [LOC France] , the authorities started releasing some of the more than 30 men who were arrested and questioned in connection with the Feb. 18 robbery , in which armed men in police suits attacked a [MISC Zurich-bound] plane minutes before takeoff from the [LOC Brussels] airport . 
Investigators in [LOC Belgium] and [LOC Switzerland] suspect that a critical organizer in the plot was [PER Marc Bertoldi] , 43 , a [MISC French] car exporter whose listed address was in a wealthy seaside neighborhood of [LOC Antibes] on the [PER Cote] d’Azur and who owns a restaurant in [LOC Casablanca] , [LOC Morocco] . 
He was arrested Tuesday in [LOC France] and remains in prison , awaiting a hearing May 16 in [LOC Metz] for extradition to [LOC Belgium] . 
Investigators said Bertoldi’s arrival in [LOC Geneva] after the theft had provided a critical breakthrough in the inquiry . 
After Bertoldi’s arrest , the police trailed an unidentified [MISC Swiss] lawyer and a real estate owner Wednesday as they made an exchange of a key to a cellar where some of the stolen diamonds were discovered . 
Bertoldi’s lawyer , [PER Olivier Rondu] , said Thursday that his client denied the accusations against him and was willing to be extradited to [LOC Belgium] to confront the charges . 
“He has a surprising position that he wants to go to [LOC Belgium] as quickly as possible to explain himself , because he says he has done nothing , ” [PER Rondu] said . 
“He denies participating in the robbery at [LOC Brussels] airport.” 
[PER Rondu] also confirmed that his client had been convicted in the past for fraud and robbery and had served a prison term . 
In [LOC Switzerland] , where eight people were arrested Wednesday , the real estate owner and the [MISC Swiss] lawyer remained in detention . 
[PER Francois Canonica] , a lawyer for the [MISC Swiss] lawyer , also denied any wrongdoing on his client’s part , telling a [MISC Swiss] newspaper , [LOC Tribune de Geneve] , “My client has faith that ultimately he will be acquitted.” 
MILITANT SAYS HE IS BEHIND FATAL [LOC NIGER] ATTACK 
[LOC DAKAR] , [LOC Senegal] - [PER Mokhtar Belmokhtar] , the mastermind of the January seizure of an [MISC Algerian] gas plant that left dozens of foreign hostages dead , has claimed responsibility for another terrorist attack - the suicide bombings on Thursday in [LOC Niger] that killed about 30 people , including 24 soldiers and at least six jihadists . 
If true , Belmokhtar’s claim would put one of the [MISC Sahel’s] most hardened militants , whom [MISC Chad’s] military said in March it had killed in battle , back at the center of the region’s fight against [MISC Islamist] jihad . 
Experts saw no reason to doubt Belmokhtar’s claim , despite the unconfirmed claim by the [MISC Chadian] military , which said that [ORG Belmokhtar] had died in the [LOC Ifoghas] mountain range during the joint [MISC French-Chadian] campaign against [MISC Islamist] militants in northern [LOC Mali] . 
Neither [LOC France] nor [LOC Algeria] , where [PER Belmokhtar] has been a wanted man for years for his role in the 1990s civil war there , ever confirmed Chad’s assertion . 
No proof was presented of his death , and a fellow militant later denied it in an [MISC Internet] posting . 
The latest claim by Belmokhtar - a veteran of training by al-Qaida in [LOC Afghanistan] , years of terrorist acts against the [MISC Algerians] and multiple kidnappings of [MISC Westerners] in the [LOC Sahara] - came hours after bomb-laden vehicles ripped through a military installation and a [MISC French-owned] uranium mine in [LOC Niger] . 
[PER Belmokhtar] , who is considered perhaps the most redoubtable of the region’s surviving militants , also played a leading role in the [MISC Islamist] takeover of northern [LOC Mali] last year . 
The new claim was made on a number of different websites . 
In one , [PER Belmokhtar] himself , using his nom de guerre [PER Khalid Abu al-Abbas] , signed a claim on jihadist forums that fighters from his “Those Who Sign with [MISC Blood”] brigade - the same group that carried out the [LOC Algeria] attack - blew up the [MISC French] mine and the [LOC Niger] base , according to the [ORG SITE Monitoring Service] , which tracks extremists . 
The claim was posted by the same user who put out a video of [MISC Belmokhtar] in December , SITE said , and it asserted that the attacks were in retaliation for purported assertions by [LOC Niger] to have defeated the jihadists . 
“We warn all the countries that are intending to participate in the [MISC Crusader] campaign on our land , even if in the name of peacekeeping , that we will make you taste the heat of death and wounds in your homelands and among your soldiers , ” SITE quoted [PER Belmokhtar] as saying . 
[LOC BRITAIN] AND [LOC ECUADOR] MAY DISCUSS ASSANGE CASE 
[LOC LONDON] - The [MISC Ecuadorean] foreign minister is due to travel to [LOC London] this month and has offered to meet his [MISC British] counterpart to discuss the impasse over the [PER Julian Assange] case , officials from both countries said on Monday . 
Assange , the founder of the anti-secrecy group [ORG WikiLeaks] , has been holed up for nearly a year in the tiny [MISC Ecuadorean] Embassy here , stymying [MISC British] attempts to extradite him to [LOC Sweden] . 
The [MISC Swedish] authorities want to question Assange in connection with accusations that he sexually assaulted two women , but he has said he fears that the [MISC Swedes] will in turn send him to the [LOC United States] to answer questions about his role in helping disseminate classified government information via WikiLeaks . 
The development concerning [ORG Assange] came on the same day as the court-martial of [MISC Pfc.] [PER Bradley Manning] , the Army private accused of passing on sensitive diplomatic and military information , was scheduled to begin in [LOC Maryland] . 
[PER Manning] has pleaded guilty to 20 of the 22 charges against him , but he has not admitted to the most serious charge , aiding the enemy . 
[PER Manning] has said he gave the material to [PER WikiLeaks] , which then helped disseminate it . 
Assange has never acknowledged that [PER Manning] was his source . 
A spokesman for the [MISC Ecuadorean] government said last week that the foreign minister , [PER Ricardo Patino] , planned to travel to [LOC London] on June 16 , three days before Assange’s first anniversary in the embassy , and to meet with [PER Assange] . 
[ORG “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador] has informed [LOC U.K.] authorities that Mr. [PER Patino] will be in [LOC London] and has offered to meet with Foreign Secretary [PER William Hague] to discuss the case of [PER Julian Assange] , ” the spokesman said . 
A spokesman for the [MISC British] [ORG Foreign Office] said it was informed of [ORG Patino’s] trip on Friday and was “considering” his request for a meeting with [ORG Hague] . 
“U.K. government officials have been in regular contact with representatives of the [MISC Ecuadorean] government , both in [LOC London] and [LOC Quito] , about Mr. [PER Assange] , ” the [ORG Foreign Office] said in a statement . 
“We hope the visit will contribute to our joint commitment to finding a diplomatic solution to this issue.” 
Last week , [ORG Reuters] quoted [PER Patino] as saying his government was preparing a document in which it would argue that [LOC Britain] is legally obliged to give Assange permission to travel to [LOC South America] . 
SOUTH AFRICAN LEADER CITES 'PROGRESS' IN MANDELA'S CONDITION 
[LOC JOHANNESBURG] - After four days in the hospital battling a lung infection , former President [PER Nelson Mandela] of [LOC South Africa] “is responding better to treatment , ” President [PER Jacob Zuma] told [ORG Parliament] in [LOC Cape Town] on Wednesday . 
“We are very happy with the progress that he’s now making , following a difficult few days , ” [PER Zuma] said . 
It was the first report of an improvement in Mandela’s condition since he was admitted to a hospital in [LOC Pretoria] early Saturday after suffering a recurrence of a persistent lung ailment , a legacy of the tuberculosis he contracted during the 27 years he was imprisoned for opposing apartheid . 
His health has been frail lately , and this hospitalization was his fourth in the last seven months . 
Government officials in the last few days had been more downbeat , describing [MISC Mandela’s] condition as “serious but stable” with no improvement . 
[PER Mandela] , 94 , is being treated in an intensive care unit , where close family members have been visiting him regularly . 
Among them are his daughters , his former wife [PER Winnie Madikizela-Mandela] and his grandson [PER Mandla Mandela] . 
His current wife , [PER Graça Machel] , canceled a speech in [LOC London] to be by his side . 
[PER Mandla Mandela] , who is a traditional leader in the [LOC Eastern Cape] village where his grandfather was born , spoke to reporters outside [MISC Mandela’s] home . 
“My grandfather is the father of the nation , ” he said . 
“He’s embraced by the global community , and we appreciate the support that we’ve received.” 
As an underground leader of the banned [ORG African National Congress] , [PER Mandela] was convicted of treason 49 years ago Wednesday . 
He was sentenced to life in prison , but was released in 1990 as the government , under intense international pressure , began negotiating with [PER Mandela] and the [ORG ANC] . 
[PER Mandela] was elected as [MISC South Africa’s] first black president in 1994 and served one term . 
He retired from public life in 2004 , and has not been seen in public since 2010 , when [LOC South Africa] hosted the [MISC World Cup] . 
MILITANTS ATTACK U.N . 
COMPOUND IN [LOC SOMALIA] 
[LOC MOGADISHU] , [LOC Somalia] - Militants staged a deadly assault on a [ORG U.N.] compound here Wednesday , the latest in a series of attacks that have chipped away at the security gains the [MISC Somali] capital has experienced in recent years . 
The [MISC Shabab] , the fearsome [MISC Islamist] militant group that once controlled much of the capital , claimed responsibility for the attack , which government officials said left at least 15 people dead , including seven attackers . 
The assault began when [MISC Shabab] militants blew up a pickup truck rigged with explosives outside the compound , witnesses said . 
Militants armed with rifles and wearing explosive vests then stormed the facility on foot . 
[MISC Somali] and [ORG African Union] troops responded to the scene . 
The ensuing firefight lasted more than an hour , punctuated by a series of blasts . 
Somalia’s minister of interior and national security , [PER Abdikarim Hussein Guled] , told reporters that the dead included four foreigners , four [MISC Somalis] working for the [ORG United Nations] as security personnel , as well as the attackers . 
In a statement , [MISC Somalia’s] prime minister , [PER Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid] , condemned “the senseless and despicable attack on innocent [ORG U.N.] civilians.” 
[LOC Mogadishu] has experienced a period of relative calm since [ORG African Union] forces and the [MISC Somali] army pushed back the [MISC Shabab] , leading it to announce a hasty retreat from the city in 2011 . 
The militant group vowed to shift tactics more toward guerrilla assaults , assassinations and suicide bombings . 
Militants “are now in complete control of the entire compound and the battle is still ongoing , ” the [PER Shabab] said on its Twitter feed during the attack . 
“Inside the compound are several clueless foreigners who were lulled into a false sense of security by a strong disinformation campaign ! ” 
The [PER Shabab] , who have sworn allegiance to al-Qaida , said that the group’s [ORG Martyrdom Brigade] had carried out the attack . 
The [ORG U.N.] compound sits on a busy stretch of road near the airport . 
An ambulance worker , [PER Abdirisak Moumin] , said that he had collected 13 wounded civilians , six of whom died from their injuries . 
[PER Nicholas Kay] , the [ORG U.N.] special representative for [LOC Somalia] , was outside the compound at a meeting nearby when the attack occurred . 
He called the attack an act of terrorism intended to derail Somalia’s drive toward recovery after decades of war and instability . 
While the [ORG United Nations] would review its security procedures , “the [ORG U.N.] is committed to its mission , ” [PER Kay] said in a telephone interview . 
“We’re here to help and we’re here to stay.” 
VIGIL FOR MANDELA CONTINUES AS FAMILY MEMBERS HOLD EMERGENCY MEETING 
[LOC JOHANNESBURG] - Singing crowds gathered outside the hospital where [PER Nelson Mandela] , [LOC South Africa’s] former president , lay in a critical state for a third consecutive day Tuesday , as family members held an emergency meeting at his ancestral village . 
Mandela’s eldest daughter , [PER Makaziwe] , at least two grandchildren and clan elders gathered at Mandela’s retirement house in [LOC Qunu] , the remote southern village where he grew up , according to news media reports . 
The subject of the meeting was not publicly disclosed , but [PER Naplisi Mandela] , an elder of the [PER Mandela] family , told the [MISC South] [ORG African Press Association] that they had gathered to discuss “delicate matters” - a euphemism widely interpreted to mean preparations for [MISC Mandela’s] death . 
Meanwhile , in [LOC Pretoria] , doctors continued to treat [PER Mandela] for a lung ailment that he contracted on [LOC Robben Island] , the notorious apartheid-era prison where he spent much of his 27 years behind bars until his release in 1990 . 
He was hospitalized June 8 , his fourth hospitalization since late last year . 
In a statement , President [PER Jacob Zuma] said [ORG Mandela’s] condition was unchanged . 
On Sunday , he visited [PER Mandela] and pronounced that his state had deteriorated from stable to critical . 
Noting that [PER Mandela’s] 95th birthday is on July 18 , [PER Zuma] urged [MISC South Africans] to celebrate his achievements . 
Still , after 18 days of anxious vigil , many appeared to be steeling themselves for the worst . 
Larger-than-usual crowds gathered at the gates of the [LOC Mediclinic Heart Hospital] to pay tribute to [PER Mandela] , as people dropped off cards at a growing shrine and sang songs . 
“There is no one like you , [PER Nelson Mandela] , ” one group sang in the [MISC Sotho] language . 
The emotional scenes were part of a perceptible shift in the national mood . 
Until recently , many [MISC South Africans] had avoided talking about [MISC Mandela’s] fate , calling it culturally inappropriate to speculate about any ailing figure , much less one as revered as [PER Mandela] , who played a central role in [MISC South Africa’s] transition from white-led minority rule to historic multirace elections in 1994 . 
But now many are openly talking about the prospect of bidding him farewell . 
Mandela’s declining condition came as President [PER Barack Obama] prepared to arrive in [LOC South Africa] on Friday on the second leg of an [MISC African] tour that will also take him to [LOC Tanzania] and [LOC Senegal] . 
But the [MISC South African] government said a planned meeting between [LOC Obama] and [LOC Mandela] - both the first black leaders of their countries - now looked unlikely . 
[MISC AFGHAN] COURT REVERSES CONVICTION IN TORTURE OF YOUNG WOMAN 
[LOC KABUL] , [LOC Afghanistan] - A court has reversed the convictions of three [MISC Afghans] jailed for torturing a young relative who had refused to become a prostitute , alarming activists who had celebrated the guilty verdicts as a warning to all those who would seek to reverse the strides made by women here in the past 12 years . 
A family had bought the young woman , [PER Sahar Gul] , from her stepbrother for $5,000 and had forced her to marry in 2011 , when she was just 13 or 14 . 
When she refused to consummate the marriage , her in-laws locked her in a basement , where they burned her with hot wires , pulled out her fingernails and twisted her skin with pliers for months . 
She was discovered in December 2011 curled up in a dank and dark corner of the cellar and badly malnourished . 
[PER Gul] now lives in a shelter in [LOC Kabul] . 
Her case attracted widespread attention in [LOC Afghanistan] and abroad . 
Three of her in-laws were convicted last year of attempted murder , and each was sentenced to 10 years in prison . 
The convictions were upheld on appeal , although her husband , who is in his 30s , remains at large . 
Last month , however , in a decision that received little publicity , the [ORG Supreme Court] sent the case back to the appeals court , saying that the violence appeared to warrant convictions for assault , not attempted murder , according to lawyers for the defendants . 
The appeals court agreed , voiding the convictions and ordering that the defendants - Gul’s mother-in-law , sister-in-law and father-in-law - be set free . 
The two women were released this week after about a year in prison , the lawyers said . 
They were not sure whether the father-in-law was yet out of prison . 
As word spread in [LOC Kabul] on Wednesday , [MISC Western] officials said they were still gathering details but would probably have a response in the coming days . 
[MISC Afghan] women’s rights activists reacted with alarm and said they would press to have the three defendants retried . 
“There’s smoke coming out of my hair . 
I am so angry , ” said [PER Manizha Naderi] , the executive director of Women for [MISC Afghan] Women . 
“This poor girl was in the basement for months . 
If she wasn’t rescued , she would be dead . 
She was starved and burned and had her fingernails pulled out . 
How is this not attempted murder ? ” 
The courts’ decisions make “a statement that violence against women is not that important , that [LOC Afghanistan] is becoming more conservative , ” [PER Naderi] added . 
[PER MICHAEL MASTROMARINO] , DENTIST GUILTY IN ORGAN SCHEME , DIES AT 49 
[PER Michael Mastromarino] , a former dental surgeon who became a tabloid sensation when he was charged with running a $4.6 million enterprise that plundered tissue and bone from corpses at funeral homes and sold them for transplants and research , died on Sunday at [LOC St.] [LOC Luke’s Cornwall Hospital] in [LOC Newburgh] , [LOC N.Y.] He was 49 and still serving a prison term . 
The cause was complications of metastatic liver cancer , [PER Mario Gallucci] , Mastromarino’s lawyer , said . 
The technology that allows the transplantation of critical organs also enables the far more common transplantation of tissue: bone can be used to repair fractures , veins for heart bypass surgery , and tendons and ligaments can restore mobility . 
Harvesting organs is allowed in [LOC New York] state , provided the donor does not carry a potentially communicable disease , the survivors approve and the person is not too old . 
But there are nowhere near enough willing donors to meet the demand for tissue , so the profit from one body can reach six figures . 
Mastromarino became licensed by [LOC New York] state to supply tissue banks and manufacturers of biological surgical instruments after his dental license was suspended in 2002 because of a drug addiction . 
He established a network of undertakers , whom he paid up to $1,000 per corpse , and soon took on assistants and formed a business based in [LOC New Jersey] , [ORG Biomedical Tissue Services] . 
He reportedly made $10,000 to $15,000 per body . 
But Mastromarino harvested organs and tissue from bodies without consent from the survivors , the authorities said , and removed material from people with cancer , [MISC HIV] and other diseases . 
He then forged paperwork , including consent forms and death certificates , to make the cause of death and age acceptable . 
The police began investigating irregularities at the [PER Daniel George] & [LOC Son Funeral Home] in [LOC Bensonhurst] , [LOC Brooklyn] , in 2005 . 
News reports included lurid details , like what the police called a secret room in the funeral home equipped with specialized surgical equipment ; leg bones replaced by PVC pipe so bodies would appear intact at viewings ( this procedure is common in lawful bone removal ) ; and the fact that one of the victims was [PER Alistair Cooke] , the [MISC British] journalist and former host of “Masterpiece Theater , ” whose arm and leg bones were taken even though he had had cancer . 
Mastromarino was charged in 2006 , along with two of his workers and an embalmer . 
He pleaded guilty in 2008 to numerous charges of enterprise corruption , reckless endangerment and body stealing and was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison . 
He and his wife , [PER Barbara] , agreed to pay $4.6 million to the district attorney’s office , to be distributed among the victims’ relatives . 
[PER Michael Mastromarino] was born in [LOC Brooklyn] on Sept. 16 , 1963 . 
He graduated from the [ORG University of Pittsburgh] and the [ORG New York] [LOC University College of Dentistry] . 
Mastromarino had surgical offices in [LOC New Jersey] and [LOC Manhattan] . 
He was a co-author , with [PER Michael R. Wiland] , of the book “Smile: [ORG How Dental Implants Can Transform Your Life.”] 
[PER Mastromarino] , who was divorced , is survived by two sons , [PER Michael] and [PER Jerry] . 
As for [PER Cooke] , his daughter , [PER Susan Cooke Kittredge] , said in an article in [LOC New York] magazine that “he would have been just horrified” by the illegal harvesting . 
But , she said , “at the same time , he would have appreciated the [MISC Dickensian] nature of it.” 
EXTRADITED COLOMBIAN TO FACE CHARGES OF DRUG TRAFFICKING 
A [MISC Colombian] who has been described by his country’s president as “the last of the great kingpins” was extradited to the [LOC United States] from [LOC Colombia] on Tuesday to face charges that he manufactured large quantities of cocaine that he then trafficked to the [LOC U.S.] and elsewhere . 
[PER Daniel Barrera] is to be arraigned Wednesday and Thursday in [LOC U.S.] district courts in [LOC Manhattan] and [LOC Brooklyn] , where he faces separate indictments . 
After those prosecutions , he will be arraigned in [LOC Miami] on additional charges , the authorities said . 
[PER Barrera] , also known as [PER El Loco] , was arrested in September in [LOC Venezuela] as a result of a complex operation that included [MISC Colombian] and [MISC Venezuelan] authorities , the [ORG CIA] , the [ORG Drug Enforcement Administration] and the [MISC British] intelligence . 
He was later sent to [LOC Colombia] , and his extradition was announced by the [LOC U.S.] attorneys in the three jurisdictions and other officials , including [PER Raymond W. Kelly] , the police commissioner of [LOC New York] ; and [PER Michele M. Leonhart] , the head of the [ORG DEA] . 
An indictment in [LOC Manhattan] says that [PER Barrera] relied on two [MISC Colombian] terrorist organizations to carry out his operations , buying raw cocaine paste from members of the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] , or [ORG FARC] , and processing it in laboratories in areas controlled by another group , to which he paid fees . 
Barrera’s organization produced upward of 400 tons of cocaine a year , “enriching itself and the two terrorist organizations it paid off , ” said [PER Preet Bharara] , the [LOC U.S.] attorney in [LOC Manhattan] . 
[PER Loretta E. Lynch] , the [LOC U.S.] attorney in [LOC Brooklyn] , said Barrera’s organization was “marked by its worldwide reach , ruthless criminality and staggering profits.” 
[PER Barrera] is charged in [LOC Manhattan] with one count of narcotics importation conspiracy , which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison . 
He faces a money laundering conspiracy charge in [LOC Brooklyn] . 
His lawyer declined to comment . 
Officials have said that [PER Barrera] , while residing in [LOC Venezuela] , changed his appearance through plastic surgery , slept in different places and burned his fingertips to try to make it impossible to identify him . 
[LOC EGYPT] CALLS FOR NEW LOOK AT MORSI PRISON ESCAPE 
[LOC CAIRO] - Egypt’s new rulers gave new credence to a court case against the ousted president , [PER Mohammed Morsi] , and members of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood] on Thursday over their escape from prison during the uprising that toppled his predecessor , [PER Hosni Mubarak] . 
The case was transferred from an appeals court to the [ORG State Security] prosecutor for further investigation . 
No charges have been filed as yet . 
Its acceptance by powerful prosecutors follows the arrest of many [ORG Muslim Brotherhood] members and is a new blow to the group by the military-backed government . 
The detentions have been criticized by rights groups and the [LOC Obama] administration , which spent Thursday walking back remarks made early in the day by a [ORG State Department] spokeswoman , [PER Jen Psaki] , seeming to criticize [PER Morsi] as undemocratic and in so doing seeming to validate the military’s move to oust him . 
At her regular [ORG State Department] briefing Thursday , asked about the reactions , [PER Psaki] said she had been “referring to all of the voices that have been - we have heard coming - the millions , I should say , coming from [LOC Egypt] , and how strongly they have voiced their views about his rule . 
But beyond that is up for the [MISC Egyptian] people to determine.” 
The renewed investigation of [PER Morsi] and members of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood] dates to the uprising that led to the ouster of [PER Mubarak] in 2011 . 
[PER Morsi] and other Brotherhood leaders were arrested Jan. 28 and held in the [LOC Wadi] [MISC Natroun] prison north of [LOC Cairo] , until they escaped two days later . 
The case languished after [PER Morsi] was elected last year in the country’s first free presidential race , although local news outlets and [MISC Morsi’s] opponents accused militants from [ORG Hamas] , the [MISC Brotherhood’s Palestinian] offshoot , of freeing their colleagues . 
[PER Morsi] has not been seen publicly since his ouster July 3 . 
It is unclear where he is being held , or whether he and the others will face the charges in court . 
The ouster of [PER Morsi] and the subsequent suppression of the Brotherhood has enraged the group’s members and led to a spate of scapegoating attacks by [MISC Muslim] extremists against [MISC Christians] they accuse of supporting his fall , rights activists said . 
While tensions between the [MISC Christian] minority and extremist elements in the [MISC Muslim] majority are not new , attacks have been reported across the country - in the northern [ORG Sinai Peninsula] , in a resort town on the [ORG Mediterranean Coast] , in [LOC Port Said] along the [LOC Suez Canal] and in isolated villages in upper [LOC Egypt] . 
No special session , but protesters leave [LOC Capitol] 
[ORG Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau] 
[LOC TALLAHASSEE] — They weren’t able to persuade Gov. [PER Rick Scott] to call a special session on the controversial ' 's tand your ground’' law . 
But the student activists known as the [ORG Dream Defenders] drew national attention to their cause by holding the longest sit-in demonstration at the [LOC Florida Capitol] in recent memory . 
On Thursday , the [MISC Miami-based] group announced that their record-setting protest is over — for now , at least . 
" After 31 days and 30 nights , we are leaving the [LOC Capitol] for our next phase , " [ORG Dream Defenders] executive director [PER Phillip Agnew] said . 
[PER Agnew] said the group would register thousands of new voters in the coming months and return to the Capitol for legislative committee hearings in the fall . 
The [ORG Dream Defenders’] occupation of the [LOC Capitol] began July 16 , three days after [PER George Zimmerman] was acquitted in the shooting death of [PER Trayvon Martin] , an unarmed teenager from [LOC Miami-Dade] . 
They promised to stay until [PER Scott] convened a special session on ' 's tand your ground’' and several other criminal justice issues . 
" We said if ( [PER Scott] ) would not give us a seat at the table , we would sleep on the floor until ( he ) gave us what we deserved , " [PER Agnew] said . 
[PER Scott] met with the protesters July 18 but refused their demands . 
The [ORG Dream Defenders] tried to persuade state lawmakers to call the session themselves , but they couldn’t muster the 96 votes needed . 
As of Thursday , 42 lawmakers had voted in favor of holding the session , 90 voted against , and 28 had yet to vote . 
This week , House Speaker [PER Will Weatherford] called for the group’s departure . 
The [ORG Dream Defenders] claimed several victories , including a promise from [LOC Weatherford] to hold a hearing on the ' 's tand your ground’' law this fall . 
The group also secured meetings with the [ORG Florida Department of Law Enforcement] to discuss racial profiling , [PER Agnew] said , and began a dialogue with the [ORG state Department of Juvenile Justice] on the disproportionate number of young [MISC African-American] men in prison . 
[PER Agnew] said the [ORG Dream Defenders] had not been pressured to wrap up their protest by the governor’s office or state law enforcement officials . 
The [ORG Capitol Police] who had watched over the group , [PER Agnew] added , ' 'd eserved a raise . " 
The state spent a total of $153,630 on police overtime throughout the protest , according to [ORG FDLE] . 
The [ORG Dream Defenders] didn’t anticipate their stay would last a month or that singer [PER Harry Belafonte] , rapper [PER Talib Kweli] or civil rights leaders [PER Jesse Jackson] and [PER Julian Bond] would join them in the [LOC Capitol] . 
" Gov. [PER Scott] , through his inaction , created a new group of leaders who will have a lasting effect on [LOC Florida] , " said state Rep. [PER Alan Williams] , a [LOC Tallahassee] [MISC Democrat] who mentored the group . 
When they packed up their belongings and left the [LOC Capitol] Thursday evening , the young activists wondered aloud if there had been some level of divine intervention along the way . 
On Wednesday , the state [ORG Department of Management Services] announced plans to test the fire alarm system in the [LOC Capitol] . 
The testing would last from 8 p.m. until midnight , and involve an " incredibly loud , high-pitch noise , " according to a press release . 
But before the testing began , the building adjacent to the [LOC Capitol] was struck by lightning . 
The [ORG Department of Management Services] decided to perform maintenance on that building’s fire alarm system instead . 
" I don’t know how to explain it , " [ORG Dream Defender] [PER Steven Pargett] said . 
" Some things are just meant to happen . " 
Times/Herald staff writers [PER Tia Mitchell] and [PER Michael Van Sickler] contributed to this report . 
A PINK-SLIP THANKS FOR A MAJOR DECISION 
On Baseball ) ; 
When [PER John Gaherin] , the chief labor negotiator for [MISC Major League Baseball] , arrived for a meeting with the chief of the players union and baseball’s arbitrator , he carried an envelope in the pocket of his suit jacket . 
It was two days before Christmas 1975 , not a time to be conducting serious business , but [PER Gaherin] and [PER Marvin Miller] , the executive director of the union , knew why [PER Peter Seitz] , the arbitrator , had summoned them . 
They knew that the subject of the meeting would be as serious a bit of business as baseball had ever experienced , and [PER Gaherin] went to the meeting prepared . 
[PER Seitz] had informally telegraphed his decision in a grievance case , and now he would formally hand his written opinion to the two men . 
As soon as he did , [PER Gaherin] handed [PER Seitz] the envelope . 
“You’re fired , ” it said in effect . 
Such is the perilous life of impartial arbitrators in baseball and other professional sports . 
Either side - the league or the union - has the right to fire them . 
Like managers , they are hired to be fired . 
“He told me he had expected as much , ” [PER Michael Seitz] , Peter’s son , said in a recent telephone interview . 
“His feeling was there was no other way to decide the case , because the baseball owners had been stupid in assuming that when they didn’t have a player under contract , they still had a contractual hold on him.” 
[PER Fredric R. Horowitz] , a 64-year-old lawyer from [LOC Santa Monica] , [LOC Calif.] , is the latest to take a turn . 
He will arbitrate [PER Alex Rodriguez’s] appeal of his 211-game suspension . 
While arbitrators pay for their decisions , which anger either the owners or the players , they don’t always receive credit for the significance of their decisions . 
[PER Seitz] , for example , was responsible for creating free agency in baseball with his decision in the 1975 [PER Andy Messersmith-Dave McNally] grievance , but I believe , as [PER Marvin Miller] used to complain , that some reports in the news media , including in [ORG The New York Times] , mistakenly credited other cases: [PER Curt Flood’s] 1970 lawsuit against baseball and [PER Catfish Hunter’s] 1974 grievance against [PER Charlie Finley] . 
Flood’s suit challenged the game’s reserve clause , the rule that bound a player to his team until he was traded , sold or released . 
Hunter’s grievance contended that [PER Finley] , the [LOC Oakland] [MISC Athletics’] owner , had breached his contract . 
The Hunter case was exactly what the union argued , a breach-of-contract case . 
[PER Finley] had not paid the premium on Hunter’s annuity , as stipulated in his contract , [PER Richard Moss] , the union lawyer , said , and the pitcher should be a free agent as a result . 
[PER Seitz] , in his first year as baseball’s arbitrator , agreed with [MISC Moss’] argument and declared Hunter a free agent . 
A year later , when [PER Seitz] ruled in the [MISC Messersmith-McNally] grievance , he did not cite the Hunter decision as a basis for this decision . 
As a breach-of-contract case , it affected no player but Hunter . 
No other player could gain free agency based on Seitz’s decision on Hunter . 
“It didn’t change the mind of a single owner , ” [PER Miller] said of the Hunter decision in one of the many conversations we had on the subject . 
" The owners’ position on free agency was the same after the Hunter case as it was before . " 
Nor , [PER Miller] added , did the [PER Flood] case affect the owners’ thinking on the reserve clause and free agency . 
The reserve clause had forever been the tie that bound players to their teams , whether they liked it or not . 
[PER Flood] did not like it , and when the [ORG St. Louis Cardinals] traded him to [LOC Philadelphia] , he opted to sue the commissioner rather than go to the [ORG Phillies] , contending that he should have the right to play where he wanted . 
The suit went all the way to the [ORG U.S. Supreme Court] , where [PER Flood] lost . 
The owners always argued that elimination of the reserve clause would ruin baseball , [PER Miller] said , and Flood’s loss in the lawsuit emboldened them to maintain their position . 
As heroic as [PER Flood] was in pursuing his lawsuit , it fell well short of having an effect . 
Its failure was one of the reasons the owners were so confident of winning the [MISC Messersmith-McNally] grievance in court when they appealed [ORG Seitz’s] decision , which said players could be free agents if they played the renewal year in their contract without signing a new contract . 
What the owners failed to understand , in their inexperience in labor matters , was that judges rarely overruled an arbitrator’s decision , doing so only if an arbitrator’s authority had been exceeded . 
The clubs and the commissioner have not done particularly well before arbitrators in instances where players have been suspended for conduct off the field . 
That history continued last year when [PER Shyam Das] overturned [PER Ryan Braun’s] 50-game suspension . 
[PER Das] was fired after his [PER Braun] ruling . 
Baseball would have preferred settling all of the doping cases stemming from the investigation into [PER Biogenesis] , an anti-aging clinic that is believed to have distributed banned substances to baseball players . 
The union also seemed eager to settle . 
But [PER Rodriguez] has appealed his 211-game suspension . 
Given the volatility of the [PER Rodriguez] case , it would not be surprising if Horowitz’s first major case were his last . 
FORMER JPMORGAN EMPLOYEE SURRENDERS IN 'LONDON WHALE' CASE 
Weeks after the [LOC U.S.] government charged [PER Javier Martin-Artajo] , a former [ORG JPMorgan Chase] employee , with hiding trading losses that ultimately reached more than $6 billion , he had his first day in court Tuesday as he surrendered to [MISC Spanish] authorities and kicked off what could be a lengthy extradition process . 
Martin-Artajo , a [MISC Spaniard] who worked in the bank’s [LOC London] office , was released soon after his surrender and arrest . 
He agreed to remain at the disposal of the [MISC Spanish] judiciary , but it was unclear whether his passport was confiscated to prevent him from leaving the country , according to a person briefed on the matter . 
The criminal charges stem from a risky bet at [LOC JPMorgan’s] chief investment office in [LOC London] , where [PER Martin-Artajo] worked . 
The bet involved so-called credit derivatives , which allow traders to bet on the perceived health of companies like [ORG American Airlines] . 
When the bet soured in the spring of 2012 , prosecutors claim , [PER Martin-Artajo] and [PER Julien Grout] , a lower-ranking employee , deliberately overstated the value of their positions to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in losses . 
The two were charged with wire fraud , falsifying bank records and contributing to false regulatory filings . 
Prosecutors also charged them with conspiracy to commit those crimes . 
The arrest in [LOC Spain] , the latest development in an episode that left a rare stain on [MISC JPMorgan’s] once-stellar reputation , underscores the challenge [LOC U.S.] authorities face in their pursuit of the traders . 
After announcing charges this month against [PER Martin-Artajo] and [PER Grout] , federal prosecutors and the [ORG FBI] in [LOC Manhattan] have encountered logistical hurdles . 
[MISC British] police issued an arrest warrant for [PER Martin-Artajo] at the behest of authorities in [LOC New York] , and then visited his house in [LOC London] only to find that he was gone . 
According to his lawyers , [PER Martin-Artajo] left [LOC London] “on a long-planned vacation” to his native [LOC Spain] without knowing of the pending charges . 
[PER Grout] , for his part , left [LOC London] this year for his native [LOC France] , which typically does not extradite its citizens . 
His lawyer , [PER Edward Little] , explained that his client also spent a brief period in the [LOC U.S.] , where his wife’s family lives . 
According to a person close to the case , both of the former traders have indicated through their lawyers that they are open to extradition but only if prosecutors recommend bail . 
Prosecutors have not charged a third trader , nicknamed “the [LOC London] [PER Whale.”] 
That trader , [PER Bruno Iksil] , has reached a deal with the authorities in [LOC Manhattan] that will spare him charges as long as he cooperates against his two former colleagues . 
LEADER OF FAR-RIGHT PARTY IN [LOC GREECE] IS JAILED 
[LOC ATHENS] , [LOC Greece] - The leader of the extreme-right [ORG Golden Dawn] party was returned to custody Thursday after appearing before a [MISC Greek] magistrate on charges of setting up a criminal organization , part of the government’s crackdown on a party described by [MISC Greek] and [MISC European] authorities as neo-Nazi and violent . 
The magistrate’s order to remand [PER Nikos Michaloliakos] , the first political party leader to face jail since Greece’s seven-year military dictatorship ended in 1974 , came a day after three of his fellow lawmakers facing similar charges were released from custody and told not to leave the country , and a fourth was ordered held pending trial . 
During more than six hours of testimony in an [LOC Athens] courtroom , [PER Michaloliakos] condemned the murder last month of a 34-year-old hip-hop artist and anti-fascist , [PER Pavlos Fyssas] , by a self-professed supporter of [ORG Golden Dawn] , and said he did not know whether members of the party were involved in violence , according to a court official . 
“I condemn the murder , like I condemn violence in general , ” he was quoted as saying . 
“I am not a [MISC Nazi.”] 
Leaving court early Thursday , [PER Michaloliakos] was defiant . 
“Long live [ORG Golden Dawn] ! 
Victory ! ” he declared as his wife , [PER Eleni Zaroulia] , another [MISC Golden Dawn] member of Parliament , cried , “You’re a diamond ! ” and his daughter , [PER Ourania Michaloliakou] , urged him , “Don’t buckle , don’t give in ! ” 
[PER Michaloliakos] was transferred to the capital’s high-security [LOC Korydallos] prison later in the day along with [PER Yiannis Lagos] , another [ORG Golden Dawn] lawmaker . 
[PER Giorgos Patelis] , the head of the party’s chapter in [LOC Nikaia] , near the spot where [PER Fyssas] was fatally stabbed , and an officer from the regional police precinct accused of supplying [MISC Golden Dawn] with information were taken to two other jails in central [LOC Greece] , state television reported . 
According to the police , [LOC Lagos] telephoned [PER Michaloliakos] half an hour after the killing of [PER Fyssas] on Sept. 18 . 
The lawmaker has been tied to protection and prostitution rackets as well as blackmail and money laundering , according to secret service documents leaked to the [MISC Greek] media this week . 
Later Thursday , a sixth lawmaker , [PER Christos Pappas] , the party’s second in command , was also ordered returned to custody after testifying for at least six hours before a magistrate . 
He was to stay overnight at the [LOC Athens] police headquarters before his transfer to prison . 
Arriving at the capital’s court complex , [PER Pappas] told reporters , “Golden [PER Dawn] will run in the next elections , whenever they may be.” 
PROTESTS [LOC AS CITY] COLLEGE CLOSES A STUDENT CENTER 
[PER Julie Turkewitz] contributed reporting . 
[LOC NEW YORK] - It was just a small room , one of hundreds in [LOC City] [MISC College’s] [LOC North Academic Center] , but over the years the [PER Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur] Student and [ORG Community Center] had taken on a significance beyond its square footage . 
To student organizers who used it as their meeting space , it was a place for lesbian and gay activists , women’s rights groups , community organizations and others to make common cause . 
To outside critics it was a symbol of campus politics gone berserk , its unofficial name a glorification of [ORG City College] alumni who had joined revolutionary organizations and gone on the lam . 
But officials at [ORG City College] , part of [LOC the] [ORG City University of New York] , insisted that charged history was not a factor when they decided that the room would be better used as an annex for the school’s career services office , two floors below . 
Without notice , security officers entered the room this past weekend , boxed up and removed its contents - and just to be on the safe side , locked down the entire building , including the library . 
With just a day to go before midterm exams , the library was reopened after a few hours . 
But Room 3/201 was not , resulting at least for a brief while in the incongruous sight of closed doors emblazoned with a bold , black fist , below a crisp white sign that read Careers and Professional Development . 
( The door had been repainted , without the fist , as of Monday afternoon . ) 
Given the center’s history , it could not have come entirely as a surprise when its former occupants let their dissatisfaction be known . 
They organized protest rallies , distributed fliers , posted videos and demanded [LOC that] [ORG City College] be shut down . 
A protester was arrested . 
And just in time for an outdoor demonstration on Monday , someone set off a fire alarm , sending hundreds of people out onto the plaza . 
“I think that the [ORG CUNY] administration is really scared of a lot of the organizing and community-building coming out of the building , ” said [PER Alyssia Osorio] , director of the [ORG Morales/Shakur Center] . 
“We provide so many services for the community - know-your-rights training , a farm share that provides healthy food , we’ve run a soup kitchen , we have provided baby-sitting services for people in the community.” 
[PER Deidra Hill] , vice president of communications at [ORG City College] , called the administration’s takeover of the room a matter of space . 
She said the career services office needed a quiet area where students can “meet with outside employers , with alumni , to seek advice on careers.” 
[ORG City College] said the unusually swift action was necessary . 
“We were concerned that we might have to move people , and that would not have been safe , ” [PER Hill] said . 
As for the protests , “Students were exercising their free speech rights , which the college supports , ” she said . 
[LOC The] [ORG City College] students whom the center’s name honors have never visited . 
[PER Guillermo Morales] , a leader of the [LOC FALN] , a [MISC Puerto Rican] independence group that claimed responsibility for a deadly bombing in [LOC New York] , fled to [LOC Cuba] . 
So did [PER Shakur] , who as a member of the [ORG Black Liberation Army] was convicted in the 1973 killing of a [LOC New Jersey] State trooper . 
In 2006 , a student objected to the name of the center . 
In the ensuing controversy , CUNY’s chancellor ordered that it be changed . 
But it stuck . 
[PER Taf Sourov] , 19 , a member of the [ORG Revolutionary Student Coordinating Committee] , a group that regularly met there , said he believed the closing was retaliation for student protests against [PER David H. Petraeus] , the former [ORG CIA] director and military commander , who is teaching a course at the [LOC Macaulay Honors College] . 
“I practically lived out of the room , ” [PER Sourov] said . 
“I would do my homework in there . 
I did my political work in there . 
I would socialize in there . 
I feel like part of me is ripped out.” 
[PER Dewhurst] wants to bill feds for undocumented prisoners 
[LOC AUSTIN] , [LOC Texas] -- Days after calling for the impeachment of President [PER Barack Obama] , Lt. Gov. [PER David Dewhurst] is demanding that the president pay for the 130,000 undocumented immigrants who are housed in county jails across [LOC Texas] -- a tab that could run nearly $157 million in the past two years alone . 
In a letter to [LOC Obama] , [PER Dewhurst] said the federal government should reimburse [LOC Texas] counties for the cost of housing the undocumented immigrants because the feds have failed to secure the [LOC U.S.] [LOC Mexico] border as they should have . 
" [MISC It’s] time we ask for that money back , " [PER Dewhurst] said in an email to supporters this week , asking them to sign a petition supporting his position . 
" It’s outrageous that county jails pay for housing to more than 130,000 people that illegally enter our state . 
" In my experience , I believe the immigration conversation begins and ends with strict border security , as our counties can no longer fund this massive financial burden . " 
In his letter to [LOC Obama] , [LOC Dewhurst] wrote: " The dollars expended in this fashion would be better spent enhancing law enforcement efforts to better protect our citizens . " 
No word yet from [LOC Washington] on what they think of Dewhurst’s demand , but don’t expect a check to be arriving anytime soon . 
[PER Dewhurst] , who has drawn three [MISC GOP] challengers in his re-election bid , has made a sharp turn to the right in his political rhetoric since losing a [LOC U.S.] [ORG Senate] runoff to tea party star [PER Ted Cruz] in July 2012 . 
Two weeks ago , [PER Dewhurst] publicly advocated [MISC Obama’s] impeachment at a tea party forum in [LOC Fort Worth] -- a move that drew surprise since it came from [ORG Texas’ No.] 2 officeholder . 
State and county officials have complained for years that detained immigrants are costing local taxpayers , and federal officials have declined to reimburse any costs because the jailed suspects are being held on local charges . 
Similarly , state officials have also complained that state prisons are holding thousands of undocumented immigrants who were convicted of state crimes . 
At one point last year , well over 12,000 state convicts had deportation detainers on them -- meaning that as soon as they complete their sentence or are paroled they are subject to being deported , officials said . 
Most are [MISC Mexican] citizens , prison officials said . 
Proposals to deport convicts serving time for nonviolent crimes before they were paroled have failed to gain support from legislative leaders , who feared if they were paroled and returned home they would simply slip back across the border into [LOC Texas] . 
The savings from that plan were estimated to be at least $15 million , officials said at the time .

[PER IKE SKELTON] , FORMER CONGRESSMAN FROM [LOC MISSOURI] , DIES AT 81 
[PER Ike Skelton] , a [MISC Democratic] congressman who was ousted in the [MISC Republican] sweep of 2010 after serving his [LOC Missouri] district for more than 30 years , died Monday in [LOC Arlington] , [LOC Va] . 
He was 81 . 
His death was confirmed by the law firm [PER Husch Blackwell] , where [PER Skelton] was a partner . 
He died at [ORG Virginia Hospital Center] after a brief illness , according to a statement from his family . 
[PER Skelton] , who was first elected to the [ORG House] in 1976 , was known as an expert on national defense and served as the chairman of [ORG House Armed Services Committee] from 2007 until leaving office . 
He was re-elected time and time again in a deeply conservative district that stretches from the [LOC Kansas City] suburbs to the [MISC Ozarks] , and he had a long record of supporting two local military institutions: [LOC Fort] [PER Leonard Wood] and [LOC Whiteman] [ORG Air Force Base] , which he secured as the base for the nation’s fleet of B-2 bombers . 
“He led an exemplary life of honor , courage and public service , ” [PER Maurice Watson] , the chairman of [PER Husch Blackwell] , said Monday in a statement . 
“His commitment to our country , the state of [LOC Missouri] and the men and women who serve our nation in the armed services was unsurpassed.” 
[PER Skelton] was a social conservative who supported gun rights , opposed abortion rights and voted against President [PER Barack Obama’s] health care law . 
Before his defeat , he had not received less than 60 percent of the vote since 1982 . 
But that record was not enough to overcome the national tide of [MISC Republicans] elected to the [ORG House] in 2010 . 
Rep. [PER Vicky Hartzler] , the [MISC Republican] who beat [PER Skelton] and still holds the seat , received support from [ORG many Tea Party] members and tied him to Rep. [PER Nancy Pelosi] , [ORG D-Calif.] , then the House speaker . 
[PER Skelton] was born in [LOC Lexington] , [LOC Mo.] , and won his first election in 1956 to become the prosecuting attorney in [ORG Lafayette County] . 
He served in the [LOC Missouri] state [ORG Senate] before entering [ORG Congress] . 
After leaving the [LOC House] , he became a partner at [PER Husch Blackwell] , working in its [LOC Missouri] and [LOC Washington] offices . 
He is survived by his wife , [PER Patricia Martin] , and three sons . 
[PER Scott] rejects Bar 's lists 
[ORG Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau] 
[LOC TALLAHASSEE] — Gov. [PER Rick Scott] , seeking to bring the court system more in line with his conservative outlook , has repeatedly rejected lists recommended to him by the [ORG Florida Bar of] lawyers seeking to screen candidates for judgeships . 
[PER Scott] has rejected dozens of attorneys the [LOC Bar] has nominated to serve on judicial nominating commissions , created decades ago to professionalize the bench and make merit and qualifications at least as important as political connections . 
" He wants people with humility , " says [MISC Scott’s] chief counsel , [PER Pete Antonacci] , " and he wants judges who will follow the law and not make it up as they go along . " 
[ORG The Bar] said Scott’s two predecessors , [PER Charlie Crist] and [PER Jeb Bush] , never rejected any of its nominees . 
All 26 nominating commissions for the trial and appellate courts and the [ORG Supreme Court] are composed of nine members . 
[PER Scott] appoints five members of his choosing and must appoint four others from lists provided by the [ORG Bar’s Board of Governors] , some of whom are liberal [MISC Democrats] who did not support Scott’s election . 
The governor has rejected the lists 16 times and has never publicly given a reason and is not required to do so . 
[PER Scott] has sent back so many Bar-recommended names that the group keeps a five-page spreadsheet to track them . 
Lawyers who are registered [MISC Democrats] , are aligned with left-leaning groups or who promote themselves as trial lawyers appear to have little hope of gaining the governor’s favor . 
Scott’s list of rejections includes: 
* [PER Benjamin Crump] of [LOC Tallahassee] , a criminal defense lawyer honored by the [ORG NAACP] for his legal advocacy and who is best known for his firm’s representation of the family of [MISC Trayvon] [PER Martin] . 
* [PER Lynn Drysdale] , a consumer protection lawyer with [ORG Jacksonville Area Legal Aid] who has testified before [ORG Congress] in opposition to state laws that allow payday lenders to target military personnel . 
* [PER W.C. Gentry] , a high-profile trial lawyer in [LOC Jacksonville] who was a member of the legal ' 'd ream team’' that successfully sued the tobacco industry in the 1990s . 
A former county school board member , he has generously contributed to [MISC Democratic] candidates and has given money to [MISC Republicans] , too . 
* [PER Tiffany Faddis] , a trial lawyer , board member of the trial bar’s statewide lobbying arm , the [ORG Florida Justice Association] , incoming president of the [ORG Hispanic Bar Association] of [LOC Central Florida] and a registered [MISC Republican] . 
[PER Antonacci] said lawyers with such backgrounds are more likely to have a " living constitution’' view of the law as evolving and ever-changing , which he said is at odds with Scott’s views . 
He said he did not know what the [LOC Florida] Bar’s agenda was in choosing which lawyers to send to [PER Scott] , and defended the practice of rejecting Bar names . 
" The [ORG Florida Bar] is not an accountable organization in any electoral way , " [PER Antonacci] said . 
" The accountability in the process is with the governor . " 
A spokeswoman for the [LOC Bar] , [PER Francine Walker] , said: " The [ORG Florida Bar] respects that the governor can reject nominees it submits . " 
[PER Deirdre Macnab] , president of the [ORG League of Women Voters] of [LOC Florida] , criticized [MISC Scott’s] frequent pattern of rejecting [MISC Bar-supported] lawyers . 
" I believe it’s unprecedented , " [PER Macnab] said . 
" This is a pretty blatant example of politicizing the court , and citizens should be concerned . 
… It’s disheartening . " 
[PER Macnab] serves on a statewide judicial nominating panel for federal judges and was appointed by [LOC U.S.] [MISC Sens.] [PER Bill Nelson] , a [MISC Democrat] , and [PER Marco Rubio] , a [MISC Republican] . 
Former [MISC Republican] state Sen. [PER Alex Villalobos] of [LOC Miami] , president of Democracy at Stake , a bipartisan group that advocates an independent judiciary , said he regretted voting more than a decade ago to weaken the [MISC Bar’s] role in judicial selection . 
Prior to that , the [LOC Bar] had three automatic slots on every [ORG JNC] . 
" That was a mistake , " he said . 
" We’re reaping what we sowed . " 
[PER Antonacci] said the pace of rejections is likely to quicken , because terms of 78 JNC members are scheduled to expire by June . 
All 78 were appointed by Scott’s predecessor and likely 2014 opponent , [PER Crist] . 
Since becoming governor in 2011 , [PER Scott] has appointed more than 100 judges statewide .

For the [ORG OP] , a conspiracy would mean there is a hidden agenda of some type . 
In this instance it 's the same agenda as before . 
Things will get better when [PER Bush] is out of office . 
maybe if you guys had some actual facts to go along with your loony tunes theories it might mean your not insane 
The irony is delicious . 
Maybe if you could find a fact or two inside that rubber room of a head of yours , people would take you seriously .

[PER Béla Biszku] ( age 92 ) , the former [MISC Hungarian] Interior Minister during communism , has been convicted of war crimes . 
A court in [LOC Hungary] has sentenced him to five and a half years in prison . 
The once-eminent pro-Soviet functionary is responsible , according to the indictment , for the death of dozens of [MISC Hungarians] shot dead during the anti-Communist and anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 . 
Biszku was found guilty today of other crimes , including denying the crimes committed during the communist regime . 
In [LOC Hungary] denial of the crimes of communism and Holocaust denial are felonies . 
The former politician may now appeal the verdict . 
Biszku is alleged to have been a member of a commission that ordered the killing of civilians during the protests of 1956 . 
His trial began in mid-March and has attracted a great deal of attention in the [MISC Hungarian] media . 
The ex-minister was able to be convicted on the basis of a law promoted and enforced by the conservative [ORG Fidesz] party of current Prime Minister [PER Viktor Orbán] that says the prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity are not subject to time limitations . 
Several thousand people died during the anti-Communist uprising in [LOC Hungary] in 1956 . 
The revolt was drowned in blood by a [ORG Soviet Army] military intervention . 
During the subsequent purges more than 200 people were executed , 22 000 ended up in prison , and 210 00 emigrated . 
" The revolt was drowned in blood by a [ORG Soviet Army] military intervention . "

In a February 13 , 1973 conversation , [PER Colson] told [PER Nixon] that he had always had “a little prejudice.” Plotz reports that [PER Colson] sought to hire [ORG Teamsters] thugs to beat up anti-war demonstrators . 
[PER Colson] also proposed firebombing the [ORG Brookings Institution] and stealing politically damaging documents while firefighters put the fire out . 
[PER Colson] 's voice , from archives from April 1969 , was heard in the 2004 movie Going Upriver deprecating the anti-war efforts of [PER John Kerry] . 
[PER Colson] 's orders were to " destroy the young demagogue before he becomes another [PER Ralph Nader] . " 
In a phone conversation with [PER Nixon] on April 28 , 1971 , [PER Colson] said , " This fellow [PER Kerry] that they had on last week.. . 
He turns out to be really quite a phony . " 
Watergate and [PER Ellsberg] scandals 
[PER Colson] also became involved in the [ORG Committee] to [ORG Re-elect] the President ( [ORG CRP] or CREEP ) . 
At a [ORG CRP] meeting on March 21 , 1971 , it was agreed to spend $250,000 on " intelligence gathering " on the [ORG Democratic Party] . 
[PER Colson] and [PER John Ehrlichman] appointed [PER E. Howard Hunt] to the [LOC White House] Special Operations Unit ( the so-called " Plumbers " ) which had been organized to stop leaks in the [PER Nixon] administration . 
[PER Hunt] headed up the [MISC Plumbers'] burglary of [ORG Pentagon] Papers-leaker [PER Daniel Ellsberg] 's psychiatrist 's office in September 1971 . 
[LOC The Pentagon] Papers were military documents about the [MISC Vietnam War] which helped increase opposition to the war . 
[PER Colson] hoped that revelations about [PER Ellsberg] could be used to discredit the [MISC anti-Vietnam War] cause .

2 . Everybody should read this before the liberal media whitewashes this asshole 's past I tried real hard to remember that [PER Colson] was a human being and he had friends and relatives who cared about him and would feel sorrow that he croaked . 
But you know what ? 
None of his friends/relatives did anything to stop him from being a miserable piece of shit . 
So fuck him and fuck them too . 
I 'm non " happy " he 's taking a dirt nap , but I 'm not unhappy either . 
He is responsible for all the [MISC Roves] , Atwaters , and even the Breitbarts who came after him .

Mine Workers and Supporters to [ORG Encircle Peabody HQ in] [LOC Downtown St. Louis] 
[LOC Union] says retirees and dependents must receive health care benefits earned during decades of labor in company mines 
[LOC St. Louis] – Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march around the headquarters of [ORG Peabody Energy] in [LOC St. Louis] this coming Tuesday , Sept. 24th . 
The event is the latest in a series of protests directed at the world’s largest private-sector coal company , which reported $90 million in net income in the second quarter of 2013 . 
[ORG Peabody] executives , however , are so far refusing to honor the company’s obligation to provide critically needed health care benefits for retired miners . 
[ORG Who: Mine] workers and supporters , including: 
· [PER Cecil Roberts] , International President , [LOC UMWA] 
· [PER Hugh McVey] , President , [LOC Missouri] [ORG AFL-CIO] 
· [PER Terrence Melvin] , President , [ORG Coalition of Black Trade Unionists] 
· [PER Claude Cummings] , Vice President , [ORG CWA District] 6 
· Rev. [PER Jonathan Stratton] , [PER Episcopal Diocese] of [LOC Missouri] 
[PER What:] March encircling [ORG Peabody Headquarters] , calling for the company to honor its obligations to retired miners and their dependents . 
When: Tuesday , September 24th , 10 am ( [LOC Central Time] ) 
Where: March to begin at [LOC Crowne] [LOC Plaza Hotel] , 200 [PER N. Fourth Street] . 
Marchers will proceed on [LOC Pine St.] to [LOC Broadway] , to Market . 
Then on [LOC Market Street] to circle around [ORG Peabody] headquarters along Market , Eighth , [PER Chestnut] and [ORG Seventh Streets] . 
Marchers will then proceed to [LOC Kiener Plaza] for a rally . 
“The [ORG Patriot Coal] chapter of this fight is behind us , now it’s time for [ORG Peabody Energy and] [ORG Arch Coal] to meet their responsibilities , ” said UMWA President [PER Roberts] . 
Last month , [ORG UWMA] members approved a settlement with [ORG Patriot Coal] , a company created by [ORG Peabody] in 2007 , which among other provisions established a mechanism for payment of health care benefits for retired miners . 
However , long-term funding for those benefits has not been secured . 
The union also won a court ruling in August establishing Peabody’s continued obligations to 3,100 miners and dependents , whose benefits remained with [ORG Peabody] at the time of the Patriot spinoff . 
[ORG Arch Coal] , another profitable company , dumped its retiree obligations into a company called [ORG Magnum Coal] in 2005 . 
Magnum was subsequently acquired by [MISC Patriot] , which entered bankruptcy reorganization last year . 
“This fight is anything but over , ” said [PER Roberts] . 
“Executives of these companies have to understand that miners and their families know the real story of what happened here – and because of our efforts , so do millions of working people across the country . 
Men and women worked underground for decades to earn these benefits . 
These companies are profitable , and they must step up to meet their obligations to these retirees.” 
The union’s ongoing effort to win full benefits for all affected retired miners includes a lawsuit against [ORG Peabody] and [ORG Arch] , filed in [LOC West Virginia] ; legislation in [ORG Congress] to aid retired miners and their dependents , sponsored by both [MISC Republicans] and [MISC Democrats] ; and an ongoing public education , advertising and community action campaign . 
Additional information is available at [LOC FairnessAtPatriot.org] .

—The [ORG University of Arkansas] campus was buzzing Friday after a student hurt himself when a gun went off in his backpack in the [LOC KUAF] building . 
[PER Matthew Williamson] admitted to 40/29 news he didn't check to see if the gun was loaded .

[PER Williamson] told 40/29 news he did not have a conceal carry license .

What was he gonna shoot at , rabbits ? 
2 . Gee , lucky someone wasn't killed he should be charged with attempted murder . 
4. who did he attempt to kill ? 
Attempted murder means that your intentions where to kill someone . 
This doesnt sound like that 
3 . Yet another reason to keep guns off the U of A campus ! 
Thank goodness no one else was hurt .

[MISC Afghan] may face death for alleged conversion 
A man in [LOC Afghanistan] is being prosecuted in a [LOC Kabul] court and could be sentenced to death after being charged with converting from [LOC Islam] to [LOC Christianity] , a crime under the country 's [MISC Islamic] sharia laws , a judge said Sunday . 
The trial highlights a struggle between religious conservatives and reformists over what shape [MISC Islam] will take here four years after the ouster of the [MISC Islamic] fundamentalist [ORG Taliban] regime . 
The defendant , [PER Abdul Rahman] , 41 , was arrested last month after his family accused him of becoming a [MISC Christian] , according to Judge [PER Ansarullah Mawlavezada] . 
[PER Rahman] was charged with rejecting [MISC Islam] . 
His trial started Thursday . 
Hmm . Looks like you beat [PER Brandon] by 29 minutes 
Does anyone know if there has been an outcome to this trial ? 
On [ORG CBC] radio this morning , the quoted an [MISC Afghan] prosecutor as saying the man is now considered mentally incompetent to stand trial . 
In yet another indication of the involvement of [MISC Pakistani] establishment in the 26/11 [LOC Mumbai] attack , LeT operative [PER David Headley] has corroborated the statement of lone captured terrorist [PER Ajmal Amir] [LOC Kasab] that the terrorists got training from [LOC Pakistan] Navy . 
During his interrogation , [LOC Kasab] confessed that the ten terrorists , including himself , who attacked [LOC Mumbai] received training of swimming and underwater diving from the [ORG Pakistan Navy] 's frogmen . 
A frogman is someone who is trained to dive , swim and combat . 
" The role of frogmen was confirmed by [PER Headley] when the [MISC Indian] investigators interrogated him in the [LOC US] last month , " an official said . 
This is being seen as another clear indicator of the [MISC Pakistani] establishment 's involvement in the planning and execution of the [LOC Mumbai] terror attack , which claimed 168 lives . 
Home secretary [PER Gopal K Pillai] had recently said that the [ORG ISI] was " literally controlling and coordinating the ( [LOC Mumbai] ) attack from beginning to end " . 
[PER Pakistani-American Headley] , currently in [MISC American] custody , was interrogated by a team of [ORG National Investigation Agency] . 
Officials said that the [MISC Indian] investigators so far have no plan to interrogate [PER Headley] 's accomplice [PER Tahawwur Hussain Rana] , a [MISC Pakistani] origin [MISC Canadian] citizen , as his involvement in the [LOC Mumbai] attack conspiracy was limited to providing finance . 
" If necessary we may interrogate [PER Rana] also , though we have no immediate plan to do so , " an official said . 
[PER Headley] has also told his interrogators that the [MISC Pakistani] intelligence agency had paid Rs 25 lakh to LeT to purchase a boat which terrorists used to travel from [LOC Karachi] to the [MISC Pakistani] maritime boundary , where they hijacked an [MISC Indian] fishing boat 'Kuber' to reach [LOC Mumbai] . 
[PER Headley] also identified through voice sample test two [ORG ISI] officers believed to be constant contact with the terrorists who carried out the 60-hour attack in [LOC Mumbai] on November 26 , 2008 . 
Officials said [MISC Indian] investigators have information that [ORG ISI] chief Lieutenant General [PER Ahmed Shuja Pasha] had met one of the handlers of the [LOC Mumbai] attack , [PER Sajjid Mir] , who is currently in a [MISC Pakistani] jail . 
" All this information have been shared by [LOC India] with [LOC Pakistan] through the multiple dossiers given to it , " the official said . 
This makes me puke . 
Nothing like going to murderers for Justice . 
It is sickening , but unfortunately we don't have many options at this point .

I believe it would come up on a [ORG CRB] enhanced check but that you would have nothing to worry about as the case was overturned . 
As an ex-employer I had to have [ORG CRB] checks done for all my staff and many had convictions , it is up to the discretion of the employer how serious the convictions are to them and their business - I can't see from what you have said how this 'conviction' would be held against you . 
Long as you wasn't acquited due to a technicality and it 's just you who 's claiming to be mistaken for someone else , then it 's all good . 
It'll show on enhanced CRB checks . 
Not sure about basic [ORG CRB] checks . 
The Crime that i was found Guilty for , was [ORG Benefit Fraud] so that 's why im a bit worried working in a Jobcentre , but then it was someone who uses these forum 's who set me up on my previous account , who managed to use all my Identity and then i got convicted but overturned by a high judge 
No It will not . 
LOCOG and the [ORG ODA] used Disclosure [LOC Scotland] for their checks 
this is a new movie that premiered the other day at [LOC Sundance] . 
It stars [PER John Cusack] as a right winger whose wife has been killed in action over in [LOC Iraq] . 
Instead of telling his two daughters about the death of their mother , he instead puts that off , and decides to take them on a road trip . 
The movie has gotten incredible buzz and was bought by [PER Harvey Weinstein] and company the first day it premiered , for a reported 4 million . 
The reviews of this movie seem to be pretty chilling . 
One reviewer talked about how instead of making a movie about the horrors of actual combat and the horrors of war , this film does what few movies I can think of at least in the war film genre seem to ever do: it focuses on wars effects on family members . 
One reviewer talked about how " the pain and terror in [LOC Cusacks] face ( while trying to tell his daughters ) never leaves " . 
I think this film really is something special and cant wait to see it . 
This could be one hell of a movie . 
[LOC Vancouver] pot activist [PER Marc Emery] to plead guilty to [LOC U.S.] drug charge 
No hope of avoiding extradition , plea deal made 
[PER Marc Emery] is facing extradition on three drug charges for selling marijuana seeds by mail order to customers in the [LOC U.S] . ( [ORG CBC] ) 
Marijuana activist [PER Marc Emery] says he plans to drop his fight against extradition to the [LOC U.S.] and plead guilty to one charge of drug distribution in a [LOC Seattle] courtroom next month . 
[PER Emery] 's extradition hearing in [LOC Vancouver] was adjourned on Wednesday so his lawyer could negotiate a deal with the [LOC U.S.] district attorney in which [PER Emery] could spend up to eight years in jail for one charge , while two other more serious charges are dropped , he said . 
" I will be making a guilty plea to one count of marijuana distribution this summer , and then when I 'm sentenced the [LOC U.S.] district attorney is going to be asking for five to eight years in a federal [LOC U.S.] penitentiary , " he told [ORG CBC News] on Wednesday . 
After the guilty plea , [PER Emery] expects he will be sentenced in August or September and is hoping he will eventually be transferred to a [MISC Canadian] jail . 
Joint [MISC U.S.-Canada] bust 
This is not the first time the marijuana activist has said his lawyers are cutting a deal with [LOC U.S.] prosecutors . 
In July 2008 , [PER Emery] said he had made a deal in which he would serve a minimum of five years in jail , but he later blamed [MISC Canadian] authorities when the deal fell through . 
The marijuana activist is facing drug charges for selling pot seeds to [LOC U.S.] customers , after his [MISC Vancouver-based] mail order business was busted in a joint operation involving both [LOC U.S.] and [MISC Canadian] law enforcement agencies in 2005 . 
He 's been fighting extradition ever since , but on Wednesday he said he now realizes it 's a fight he 's not going to win . 
" Ultimately my lawyer is convinced that the [MISC Canadian] government has never refused an extradition request from the [LOC United States] and it 's not going to start now , " he said . 
" Sometimes you have to face up to the reality of what 's going to happen , and under this scenario I may be free out of prison in two or three or four years , " he said . 
Without the deal , [PER Emery] said , he would be facing much more time in jail . 
" This is a preferential arrangement to the not-so-good-arrangement that would see me spend 10 , 20 , 30 years in a [LOC U.S.] federal penitentiary , foreseeably the rest of my life , and that doesn't give a person a lot of hope , " he said . 
Prepared to do time 
" The [ORG DA] wants to paint me as a large player providing a lot of marijuana to people , and we'll bring up that it was only seeds and it was totally transparent . 
It was done in [LOC Canada] out in the open for 10 or 12 years , " he told [ORG CBC News] during an interview at the busy downtown [LOC Vancouver] hemp store he still operates . 
" I didn't keep any of the money — $4 million . 
I gave it all away to activist groups around the world , so my motives are unusual , so that does mitigate in sentencing , " said [PER Emery] , who frequently ran in provincial and federal elections as the leader of the [ORG Marijuana Party] . 
But the man who once spent more than two months in a [MISC Canadian] prison for passing a joint to an undercover officer is now preparing for a much longer stay in a [LOC U.S.] prison . 
" You 've got to keep busy in jail . 
You 've got to be reading , in my case writing . 
I'll be learning [MISC Spanish] , [MISC French] . 
You 've got to have projects , " he said . 
*sigh* 
That 's what happens when you have [PER Stephen Harper] in Parliament . 
[ORG Stupid Conservative Government] . 
It 's disgusting that instead of dealing with Mr. [PER Emery] like a responsible government should - we pass him off like a hot potato to the [LOC USA] for them to deal with , and to be prosecuted under their laws where he has no bargaining power and fewer rights . 
*spits* 
I hate seein the prince go to jail 
twas a stupid mistake though 
I can't believe it 's actually going to happen . 
I remember reading about this forever ago and thinking " ah he'll be fine " fuck man. . 
Fuck [LOC america] . 
Fuck [LOC america] . 
No , [LOC America] is alright , but fuck the [MISC American] government . 
Fuck the [MISC Canadian] government too . 
haha They're the ones who're gonna agree to extradite him , in the first place . 
It 's fookin rediculous that he will be sentenced to a few years in jail just for selling seeds . 
He should be praised , instead of martyred 
Fuck governments in general . 
Another innocent man falls victim to the Machine . 
When will the madness end ? 
It 's _a_fucking_shame_what 's _happening_to_him , _but_ he_is_a_little_out_there._Not_eaxctly_the_best_spo kesperson_for_marijuana 
Is your space bar broken ? 
YES 
Yes_it_is . 
yea he has always been a little nutty... . 
publicly speaking out about destroying the [ORG DEA] single handedly lol 
[LOC Emery] rocks . 
And he 's awesome . 
That 's a shame :/ 
[ORG IFC] signs deal to expand insurance to farmers in [LOC East Africa] 
[LOC NAIROBI] , Nov. 25 ( [ORG Xinhua] ) -- [ORG International Finance Corporation] ( [ORG IFC] ) has signed agreements with three partners to expand access to insurance to thousands of farmers and livestock herders in [LOC Kenya] and [LOC Rwanda] to help protect their crops , animals and livelihoods from weather-related risks and natural disasters . 
[ORG IFC] , through the [ORG Global Index Insurance Facility] ( [ORG GIIF] ) , will confer grants totaling roughly 4.1 million [PER U. S.] dollars to the [ORG Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture/UAP Insurance] weather index insurance initiative in [LOC Kenya] ; the [ORG International Livestock Research Institute] ( [ORG ILRI] ) Livestock index insurance project in northern [LOC Kenya] ; and the [MISC MicroEnsure] weather index insurance project in [LOC Rwanda] . 
" These partnerships highlight [ORG IFC] 's commitment to expanding insurance and other financial products where they are needed most in [LOC Africa] . 
The [ORG Global Index Insurance Facility] will facilitate farmers' access to credit , leading to increased productivity , improved livelihoods and greater food security , " [PER Jean Philippe Prosper] , [ORG IFC] Director for [LOC Eastern] and [LOC Southern Africa] said . 
" We are grateful to the donors that have generously provided funding and to our partners for supporting this program . " 
The grants , the first three provided under the [MISC GIIF] program , will help bring weather-related , index-based insurance to about 35 , 000 farmers and 5,000 livestock herders in [LOC East Africa] over the next three years . 
" The implementation of these three first GIIF projects in [LOC Kenya] and [LOC Rwanda] will support the development of new insurance products and will increase expertise in this field , which will benefit smallholders and livestock keepers affected by climatic events , " he said . 
" In addition to the [LOC GIIF] , the [ORG European Union] is providing further financing to the [ORG ILRI Livestock Insurance] project in [LOC Kenya] through the 10th [ORG European Development Fund] , [ORG Kenya Rural Development Project] that will start in 2011 . " 
[ORG IFC] will confer a grant of up to 2.4 million dollars on [ORG Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture] , which expects to help insure 20,000 farmers in [LOC Kenya] over the next three years 
[ORG IFC] will confer a grant of up to 154,000 dollars on the [ORG ILRI] , which expects to help insure 5,000 livestock herders in northern [LOC Kenya] over the next two years . 
[ORG IFC] will confer a grant of up to 1.6 million dollars on MicroEnsure , which expects to insure 15,000 farmers in [LOC Rwanda] over the next three years . 
[ORG IFC] 's [ORG GIIF] program was established in 2009 to assist the development of index-based insurance for natural disasters and weather risks in developing countries , where insurance is rarely available . 
The grants will fund advisory activities , including local capacity building , infrastructure development , product development , and development of local insurance companies' capacity to provide index-based insurance products . 
Index-based insurance insures against catastrophic events , such as wind storms or droughts , depending on their severity . 
Index-linked insurance products eliminate the need for insurance companies to individually verify claims , reducing transaction costs and making it easier for the products and services to be offered to rural communities and in frontier regions . 
[ORG The European Union] committed 24.5 million euros as the first donor to the [ORG GIIF Trust Fund] . 
The fund is also supported by [LOC Japan] 's [ORG Ministry of Finance] with an initial grant of 2 million dollars , and the [ORG Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs] , which provided funding to establish the facility .
